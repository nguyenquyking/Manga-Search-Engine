They found a spiky beetle without spikes, so they called that a \"spikeless spiky beetle,\" and then there was a member of that subfamily that did have spikes, making it a \"spiky spikeless spiky beetle.\" I'm thinking that there are probably some of them that can't fly, and a few of those are particularly quick to move on to other situations, making them \"flighty flightless spiky spikeless spiky beetles.\" Meanwhile, here's \"Wano's getting mighty breathless in volume 98!\"",
