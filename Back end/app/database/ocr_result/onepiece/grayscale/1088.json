Anyway, after their father was tried as a criminal, these two siblings had to work as entertainers and suffer the abuse and manipulation of cruel adults. They could only survive by relying on each other. One of their skills was sharpshooting, and Izo was a master at it. But he was never confident with the katana. Later, when they were on Whitebeard's ship, Izo was hitting targets to entertain the crew, when Vista the Flower Sword said to him, \"Use your best skill to protect your master!!\" If a samurai is sworn to protect his master, why fixate on the sword if you're not good at it? \"Samurai\" is meant to be a way of life. So Izo put down the sword and picked up the gun instead.",
