It's not so much that I'm \"quitting\" as that the series will end when I've finished drawing the most exciting part of Luffy's adventures, which is the big story of what the One Piece is. But right now we're in a really exciting story in the land of Wano. But if Luffy manages to survive and sail away, I'll be drawing major international developments, the \"Biggest Battle in One Piece history,\" which will be a thrilling and wild story, the likes of which no one's read before. It'll be great!! So I put out a statement indicating that this very long story is actually moving toward an ending, so that you readers can mentally prepare yourselves. But for now, we're in Wano and it's really heating up, so sit back and enjoy it. I'll draw with all of my strength!!",
