It was from a person whose pen name was \"Eeyan,\" and they wanted me to check out their YouTube page. And it was full of videos of homemade figure construction! Huh? Strange, that figure looks familiar, I thought...and it turns out it was from the very person whose figure photos they'd sent in for the fan art section! It's so fascinating to see readers of mine become famous YouTubers! Go to YouTube and search for \"EEYAN.\" Good luck with your figures! Oh, he said he also has a collab video with Sanadacchi, but you don't need to look at that one!",

Ugh, the nerve of those perverts! Anyway, I've decided to live out of a bathhouse.\n--Sanadacchi",

No, not mine!! Sanadaaaa... Okay, enough of that. All of you who heard about mixed bathing and got dirty thoughts in your heads, just because it was long in the past doesn't mean people didn't have shame. So now you've learned something about how the culture of Japan protected the virtue of young ladies!",
