At a glance, it is easy to presume\nthat it's still the same as from the previous sentence,\nbut we feel that \"answers\" is more appropriate given\nthe context of the speech as a whole since it maintains\nambiguity and fits the intent best.\nAssuming otherwise gives the impression that Wano holds part\nof the treasure. This impression isn't evident in the Japanese,\nso the wording we settled on leaves that option open while also\naccurately conveying the intended meaning of her monologue.\nHer core frustration with Roger is over the lack of information\nhe left behind. Her dialogue suggests that Wano might hold the\nkey to some of these mysteries. Making sure that nuance\ncomes across was our top priority.",
