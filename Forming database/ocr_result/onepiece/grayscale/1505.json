Initially I was thinking about how the comedian and actress Naomi Watanabe has such an incredible and vibrant presence, so I based Shinobu on her. But eventually I started thinking, you know, she reminds me of someone...

Plus, Jane was beautiful when she was younger too, so it's really impossible to deny!",
