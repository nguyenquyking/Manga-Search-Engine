At the end of their journey, they encounter a massive waterfall. Most of the Koi give up and let the river's current carry them away. A few persist and carry on trying to reach the top of the waterfall. After hundreds of years, a single Koi reaches the top. The gods recognize this Koi for its determination and bestow upon it the gift of transformation into a dragon. Because of its bravery, the Koi is also oftentimes associated with Samurai.",
