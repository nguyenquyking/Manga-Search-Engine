He does this because he made a promise with his old best friend when he was a kid. They promised that one of them would become the strongest in the world, and the sword he bites now is a memento of that friend after she died. Now Zoro uses three swords because he turns his friend's sorrow into strength! So he bites his sword even if his teeth hurt! He'll do it until he becomes the best in the world!!
