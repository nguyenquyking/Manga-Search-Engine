I don't think she tamed that with her Devil Fruit powers. I'm guessing there's a sweet and touching story behind it. Am I right?",

It was Hitetsu's prized teakettle, and well taken care of, so when it gained its powers, it stuck around with Hitetsu and Otama. Since it's alive, it can't be put over a fire. It's just a pet that can't boil water anymore.\nHowever, there's one thing I wanted people to notice and point out, and nobody sent in any letters about it, so I guess I have to announce it here! Look closely at little Bunbuku there...\nHe's sitting on his own balls!! (LMAO)\nAnd nobody noticed!! I was cracking up to myself when I drew it!!",
