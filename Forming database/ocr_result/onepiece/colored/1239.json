But the local stone carvers just thought, \"What's a komainu?\" They had never seen one before. There were no internet image searches, no fax machines. So those stone carvers did what they could: they used their imagination to create what they imagined a traditional komainu to look like. The result is known as Hajime-Komainu, or the \"first komainu\"! They look real funky!! Try doing an image search for them!",
