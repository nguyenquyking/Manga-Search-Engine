As a matter of fact, about 20 years ago, when the TV anime series was starting, the producer Mr. Shimizu from Toei Animation, whom I call \"The Father of One Piece,\" asked me the same thing. The fact that I was so particular about this phrasing was a sign to Mr. Shimizu, and convinced him that One Piece was going to be a success!! And the reason for my particular obsession is...!!! To be continued (not). I just think it's a powerful statement, grammatically. If I was the kind of person who wrote it the standard way, I don't think I would've been able to depict Luffy the way he is! So the answer is: it was just on a whim!",
