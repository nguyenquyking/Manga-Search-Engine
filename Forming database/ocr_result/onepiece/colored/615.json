The basic format is just \"Animal plus Character doing _______\", and I like having a lot of them involve the Straw Hats. At first, I thought, I want to get as many people's requests in as possible, so I only drew one for each individual. But some people are so good at making requests that tickle my fancy, and I got tired of worrying, \"I can't draw this person's request for a second time, even though I really like this prompt,\" so I decided that I'll just draw the ones I like, no matter what. If you can capture my interest through the animal choice and character choice, I will happily draw your request. Drawing is my hobby, after all. If I want to draw it, I'll even use it for a two-page color spread. So put animals in those too. After 22 years of this, I've drawn just about everything, so the newer and fresher the request, the more fun it is for me.",
