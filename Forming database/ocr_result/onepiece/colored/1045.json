Since this is Wano, an analogue for old-time Japan, there needs to be Japanese writing on the signs and such in the background, and it would be too much for me to give directions on every single little thing, so I tell them that if they need ideas for background text, to hide words and Easter eggs relating to One Piece in the background.
