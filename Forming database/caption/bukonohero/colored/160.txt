A manga-style comic depicts a nighttime urban scene where a character, possibly Lady Nagant, attacks with energy blasts.  Another character, possibly a hero, is shown evading the attack amidst buildings in the rain.  The hero's secure line is destroyed.  Text boxes reveal internal thoughts and observations of the characters, indicating a chase and the hero's inability to warn others about Nagant's pursuit.  The visual style is dark and gritty, emphasizing the action and tension.
