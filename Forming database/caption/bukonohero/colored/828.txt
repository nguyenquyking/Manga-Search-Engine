One Piece manga panel depicting a tense scene.  Several League of Villains members, including Machia, are shown maneuvering around a powerful, unnamed opponent.  They strategize, acknowledging the opponent's overwhelming strength and the risk of engaging directly.  One member expresses concern about their physical limitations. Another member, possibly a doctor, confirms they're listening to the strategy.  A separate panel shows another member successfully burning an icy enemy. The overall mood is one of urgency and peril.
