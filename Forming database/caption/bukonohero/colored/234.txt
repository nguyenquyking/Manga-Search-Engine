This One Piece manga panel depicts a conversation between two characters.  A stern-faced, older character with long silver hair and pink eyes, who states he "died of old age," is speaking to a younger character with bright green hair, who appears shocked. The older character recounts a past era, describing a "weirdo" named Shinomori who shunned society.  Another panel shows a fight scene, possibly illustrating Shinomori's actions. The green-haired character speculates on the older character's death, referencing All Might's notes.  The overall mood is serious and reflective, focusing on a past event and its lingering impact.
