My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a mission briefing.  Multiple characters are shown: a dark-haired man in a white scarf, a blond man, Izuku Midoriya (with green hair), a group including Ochaco Uraraka (brown hair), Tsuyu Asui (green hair), and Eijiro Kirishima (red hair), and an older man with grey hair and a mask.  A suited man addresses the group, stating the objective: swiftly and precisely locating and rescuing a child.  A female character with light green hair and dark clothing is also present, seemingly acknowledging the mission. The overall tone is serious and urgent.
