Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A multi-panel scene depicting a powerful explosion in a city, followed by a close-up of a severely injured Tenko, his face bloodied.  The next panel shows Tenko's grandmother comforting him, while his father offers him a plate of *ohagi* (a type of Japanese sweet rice cake). The text bubbles convey the grandmother's concern and the father's attempt to cheer him up with his favorite food. The overall scene contrasts the destruction and Tenko's suffering with the warmth of his family's support.  Key elements include the destruction, Tenko's injuries, the *ohagi*, and the family's interaction.
