One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of emotional farewell.  Two characters, one seemingly injured and reaching out a hand, while the other, partially obscured, offers a hand in return.  Speech bubbles indicate words of encouragement ("Do your best," "You deserve to rest") and a declaration of burden ("You're the only one who can bear this burden"). A final panel shows a blond-haired character falling to the ground; a food container is nearby. The scene suggests a significant emotional moment and the transfer of responsibility.
