My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya (Deku) unleashing a powerful, green energy-based attack.  He's screaming in exertion, tears streaming down his face.  The attack impacts All For One, who is shown severely wounded and surrounded by dust and debris. Another character, possibly Endeavor, is seen in the background warning Deku to stay back.  The final panel shows All For One's injured state, and a speech bubble indicates his recognition of Deku's power.  The overall scene depicts a powerful and intense battle with significant damage inflicted upon All For One.
