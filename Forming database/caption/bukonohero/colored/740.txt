A manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A severely injured Mirko, bleeding profusely, falls through a dark, technological environment.  In the upper panel, a bloodied, enraged antagonist with a white headwrap speaks, saying "If you're gonna die, get the job done first..."  The antagonist's focus is on Mirko's impending doom. A scientist-like figure observes the scene in the background.  The overall tone is violent and dramatic.
