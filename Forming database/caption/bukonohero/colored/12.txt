A nighttime scene in a dilapidated urban area shows graffiti-covered walls and buildings.  The graffiti includes phrases like "Demon," "Toga the Terrible," "Get Lost," "Your Fault for Having Her Vampire Demon's Lair," and "Scum Family."  The scene depicts a dark and ominous atmosphere.  The lower panels show a pair of legs in dark shoes and socks, suggesting a person is present.  Text bubbles indicate a dialogue about a demonic girl and failed attempts to address the situation.
