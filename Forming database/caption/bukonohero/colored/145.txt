Manga panel depicting a dramatic action scene.  A man with dark hair and a wide-open mouth shouts "Take me to the boss! Now!!" Another character, possibly Izuku Midoriya (based on visual similarity), is shown snapping his fingers, with text indicating he's increasing his shot velocity despite the risk of jamming.  A third character, with long, light-blue hair, is shown launching a projectile from a rooftop in a rainy city at night. The dialogue suggests a deal was made, and the hero's training instilled a strong aversion to something.  The overall mood is intense and action-packed.
