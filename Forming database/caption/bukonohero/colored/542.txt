A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, red, seemingly powerful figure is shown collapsing amidst a flurry of red energy blasts, suggesting a powerful attack.  Several smaller figures, presumably heroes, are scattered around the scene, some appearing injured or defeated.  Text indicates this figure was a "savior and liberator" attacked by "pesky heroes."  In subsequent panels,  members of the Liberation Army, including a character resembling Twice (with his multiple clones) and another unidentified character in dark clothing and mask, react.  Twice's clone is in motion, responding to a command to "get closer," while the other character announces that their revolution has begun, referencing "Gigantomacia." The overall scene suggests a pivotal moment in a larger conflict, focusing on the aftermath of a decisive attack and the ensuing response from the Liberation Army.
