They discuss the strategy of using Midoriya as bait to draw out the Liberation Front, acknowledging the potential negative media attention.  The heroes are concerned about putting Midoriya in further danger, debating about increasing the distance between themselves and Midoriya.  Edgeshot is driving; Hawks is in the passenger seat.
