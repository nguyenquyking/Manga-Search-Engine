A manga panel depicting a battle between two characters.  One, with dark spiky hair and stitched facial scars, is  Dabi (likely), displaying a grim expression. He observes a wounded blond character, likely Hawks, lying on the ground. Hawks's wings are damaged and he appears severely injured.  Dabi states that he inflicted enough damage to prevent a full-blown rampage and that he avoided vital organs. Hawks acknowledges this, noting his injured wings and the difficult fighting conditions. The scene emphasizes the severity of the fight and Hawks's compromised state.
