One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion about precognition.  Nighteye, with his distinctive hairstyle and glasses, argues with another character (possibly a subordinate) about the limits of foresight.  A third individual, in a suit, sits dejectedly at a desk, stating "I can't," indicating his inability to prevent a foreseen event despite having the information. The scene highlights the debate between fatalism and the possibility of intervention when dealing with precognitive abilities.  The panel also includes text boxes discussing the implications of using a quirk that increases the success rate of actions.
