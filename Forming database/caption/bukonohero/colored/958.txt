My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion about Chisaki Kai (Overhaul).  A screen shows Chisaki wearing a plague doctor mask. A character (likely a detective or analyst) gestures, explaining Overhaul's Quirk, which can disassemble and reassemble any target, and is used with Quirk-destroying bullets.  Another character, possibly Izuku Midoriya, reacts with a concerned expression. The overall tone is serious and investigative, focusing on the analysis of Overhaul's power and his connection to organized crime.
