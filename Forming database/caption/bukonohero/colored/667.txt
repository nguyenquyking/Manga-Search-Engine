A colored manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  Dark Shadow, a dark, shadowy figure, is launching a powerful blue energy blast at Fumikage Tokoyami, who is visibly strained and struggling to dodge.  The force of the attack is emphasized by motion lines and sound effects ("BWOOOM," "FWAH," "SZZL," "SHP").  Subsequent panels show Fumikage injured and expressing his inability to dodge ("Too cramped! Can't dodge!"), while text bubbles reveal his thoughts and intentions to escape and seek aid for Hawks.  The overall scene suggests a fierce battle and a desperate attempt to escape a dangerous situation.
