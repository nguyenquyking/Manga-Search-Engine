One Piece manga panel depicting a violent clash.  A character (likely Luffy, given the small figure embedded in the larger character's arm) is shown launching an attack, "Red Riot," against a significantly larger, muscular opponent.  The attack is depicted with red energy bursts and impact sounds ("SHNK"). The larger character is wounded, with blood splatter evident.  The scene shows intense physical combat, with the smaller character's attack causing noticeable damage to the larger one.
