A manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Deku, the inheritor of One For All, smiles fiercely in the rain, addressing a large, monstrous figure.  Another character, possibly a friend or ally, observes Deku. The monstrous figure appears distressed or intimidated. Speech bubbles indicate Deku's resolve to protect others ("Those smiles...everyone's peace of mind") and his opponent's fear. The overall tone is intense and action-oriented.
