A manga panel depicting the aftermath of a catastrophic event in Jaku City.  A helicopter flies overhead as rescue teams comprised of heroes and law enforcement officials assist citizens in evacuating a heavily damaged cityscape.  A news reporter, seen in a separate panel, describes the extensive destruction—approximately one-third of the city reduced to rubble—and notes the similarity to a previous disaster in Deika City. The smoke and dust hinder clear visibility of the heroes' actions.
