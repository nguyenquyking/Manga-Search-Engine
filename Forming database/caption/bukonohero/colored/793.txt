Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  "A dynamic action scene depicts two characters mid-battle against a dark space backdrop.  The character in the foreground, seemingly using a powerful attack called 'Luna Tijeras,' is mostly obscured, only their powerful legs and long white hair visible.  A second character, with brown skin and light-colored clothing, is shown from the back, seemingly falling or being thrown during the attack.  The powerful attack creates a swirling, purple energy effect, destroying rocky debris around them."
