Multiple panels depict a group of students discussing their studies and a separate panel shows a character on the phone, seemingly troubled.  Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, and Eijiro Kirishima are shown initially discussing the importance of dedication to studies.  A female student expresses concern about the difficulty of the material.  Another panel depicts Midoriya, along with blond and black-haired female classmates, further discussing academic pressures.  A final panel shows a character, possibly Tomura Shigaraki, on a phone call, expressing discomfort with a story involving All Might, Mirko, and Nighteye.  The overall theme is academic pressure and a contrasting, serious personal matter.
