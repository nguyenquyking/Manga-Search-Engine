My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Bakugo Katsuki's reaction to a letter.  He suspects All Might's involvement in a crime, referencing a meeting between All Might, Deku (Midoriya Izuku), and Hawks (the "Spoonbill").  Bakugo is shown expressing concern and frustration, contrasting this with the relatively calm reactions of other characters (possibly Todoroki Shoto and another unnamed character) who are discussing the lack of news about All Might. The panel highlights Bakugo's worry and his belief that All Might and a partner are involved in criminal activity.
