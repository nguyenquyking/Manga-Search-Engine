Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A panel from a manga depicting a scene in what appears to be Sir Night Eye's office.  Izuku Midoriya and another student look shocked as a blue-haired female student is restrained and tickled by a device labeled "Tickle Hell." A man in a suit observes the scene. The text bubbles express the students' surprise and the man's observation.  The overall tone is comedic yet slightly unsettling due to the nature of the device.
