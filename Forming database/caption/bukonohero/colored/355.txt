Here's a detailed caption for the provided manga image:  A colossal, rock-like figure looms over Endeavor (in orange and black) and another smaller, less defined hero. Endeavor appears to be in a defensive posture.  The large figure intends to "smash it all to dust". In a separate panel, a scarred, white-haired character, likely Toya Todoroki, confronts a bloodied Endeavor, refuting Endeavor's claim that Toya is dead.  Toya asserts his survival and accuses Endeavor of a "despicable lie" due to his oversight in not suspecting Toya's involvement.  The scene depicts a dramatic confrontation filled with tension and suggests a family conflict with high stakes.
