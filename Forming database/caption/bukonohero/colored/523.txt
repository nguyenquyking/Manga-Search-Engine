A large, muscular, dark-skinned man with spiky dark hair is being pulled down by several smaller figures using ropes.  He's yelling "GOOO!!" and "GO, GO!"  A separate panel shows a character, possibly the leader, with spiky dark hair and a headset, shouting "RIGHT ON TARGET!".  The smaller figures appear to be a team working together, pulling the large man down into the ground. The scene takes place in a forest. One of the smaller figures is using a plant-like power, possibly vines.  The final panel shows a close up of a woman using a plant-like power. The text "FORGIVE US OUR NUMBERS ADVANTAGE" is present, indicating a strategic numerical superiority.
