My Hero Academia manga page depicting Hawks (blonde, winged hero) and a shadowy figure, possibly Mr. Number Two, interacting. Hawks seems pleased, while the other character grants power or makes a proposition.  The scene suggests a post-conflict situation, with a final task remaining before contacting Endeavor and others.  A smaller panel shows Hawks with other characters, potentially celebrating a victory. The overall tone is tense yet triumphant, hinting at unresolved plot points.
