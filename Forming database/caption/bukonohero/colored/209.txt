A blonde female character, possibly a protagonist, shouts "We don't want you to die!" while another character, a male with short grey hair, is attacked and exclaims "Too bad you ain't our boss!".  The male is being physically pushed.  In the background, several other characters are shown fleeing from a powerful energy blast (labelled 'SHOOM').  A large, red, monstrous entity is shown destroying a building in the foreground; the destruction is significant.
