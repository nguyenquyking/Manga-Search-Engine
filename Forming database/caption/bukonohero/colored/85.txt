A manga panel depicting a discussion about heroes and their public image.  The scene shows several panels: one with an empty stage, representing the performative nature of heroism; another with a crowd watching a hero (All Might, implied but not explicitly named) from behind; and dialogue boxes discussing the superficial aspects of heroism versus the inner qualities.  The characters are unnamed in most panels, but All Might is visually identified by his costume and pose in the final panel.  The overall theme is the contrast between the idealized image of a hero and the reality of their dedication and personal sacrifices.
