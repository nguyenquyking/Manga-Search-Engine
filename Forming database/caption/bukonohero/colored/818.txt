A manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A large, powerful figure with white hair and a single red eye dominates the central panels, his expression grim. Text bubbles indicate shock and urgency ("NO WAY...", "RE-DESTRO!!"). The background shows a devastated landscape with a vehicle seemingly escaping amidst rubble and people.  Smaller panels show panicked individuals, one group yelling "EVERYONE! SAVE OUR GRAND COMMANDER!" Another panel shows a man reacting in disbelief ("MY INCITE...IT'S BEING DROWNED OUT IMPOSSIBLE!").  The overall mood is one of intense destruction and desperate action.  The scene suggests a powerful character, possibly the "Grand Commander," is in grave danger.
