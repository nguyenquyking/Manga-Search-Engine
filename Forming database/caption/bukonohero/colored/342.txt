My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a powerful attack.  Midoriya (Deku) is critically injured, bleeding profusely, as a large blue energy blast impacts him. Endeavor observes, commenting on the similarity to past events.  Another character (possibly Shoto Todoroki) is also shown, seemingly affected by the blast.  The scene is chaotic and violent, showing the destructive power of the attack. The words "Hado!!" and onomatopoeia indicating the impact and speed of the attack are present.
