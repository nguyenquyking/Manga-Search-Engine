One Piece manga scene depicting a large, dark grey mech, "CLAUSTRO," featuring Detnerat's patented Burden-Amplifying Steel Pressure Mechanism.  A character with white hair, possibly Law, reacts with surprise ("Oh Yeah?"). Another panel shows a man in a suit seemingly observing. The mech is shown in action, with onomatopoeia suggesting movement and metallic sounds ("Klang"). The overall scene suggests a powerful, potentially overwhelming force.
