One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion about the limits of a character's power, referred to as "Life Power."  The panel shows a blonde woman, possibly a New Order member, whose power is being analyzed. The text discusses the limitations of affecting living beings versus inanimate objects.  The analysis focuses on the range and precision of her power, noting that she can control a "gauge" at will, but there are limits to how much she can incapacitate a living person.  The panel also features a graphic depicting a "Life Power" meter.
