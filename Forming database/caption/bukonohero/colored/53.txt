Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga image:  A colossal, blue, vaguely humanoid figure dominates the top panel, with a smaller craft approaching it.  A speech bubble indicates the craft's intent to destroy the giant. The middle panel shows a close-up of a blonde, powerfully built man, his face expressing intense focus. The bottom panel depicts two men, one dark-skinned and one light-skinned, with the dark-skinned man urging the blonde man, who is likely "Star" (as suggested by the caption), into action. The scene suggests a confrontation between a powerful enemy and a determined team.
