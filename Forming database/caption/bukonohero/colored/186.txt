Other characters, possibly civilians, are seen fleeing in an earlier panel.  The fox-woman expresses concern about Deku's nighttime wandering.  Deku explains his actions, revealing his fear and initial response to the situation. The overall mood is tense, but the scene focuses on the interaction between Deku and the fox-woman.
