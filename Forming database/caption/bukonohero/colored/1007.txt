A manga panel depicts a scene with two characters.  A man in a white coat and glasses, holding a small, dark seal, instructs a surprised green-haired young man, possibly Izuku Midoriya, to obtain the seal within three minutes. The man in the white coat comments on the young man's poor sense of humor but offers him a chance.  Another character, referred to as "Bubble Girl," is instructed to leave the room.  The overall scene suggests a challenge or test related to heroism.
