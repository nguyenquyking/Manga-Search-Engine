A manga comic panel depicting a scene with several characters.  Eri, a young girl with long light-green hair and horns, is in bed looking distressed. A man in a suit, seemingly addressing Eri, is shown expressing relief that she hasn't touched any toys. Another man, with spiky blonde hair, menacingly threatens to disassemble someone's neck.  A third character, also a man, is shown reassuring Eri with a gentle pat. The scene suggests a tense situation where Eri's well-being is at risk, and the men have contrasting intentions towards her.
