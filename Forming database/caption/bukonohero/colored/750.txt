Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A dynamic action scene featuring Dabi (a villain with blue flames and scarred face) in the foreground, moving at high speed.  He is trailed by a burst of cyan flames. In the background, several other characters are fleeing, possibly members of the opposing team.  One character, possibly a blonde male, is visible in a smaller panel, seemingly surprised by Dabi's speed. The overall scene takes place within a large, damaged room or hallway. The text "Too Fast!" emphasizes Dabi's incredible speed.
