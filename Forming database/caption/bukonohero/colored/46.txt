A massive explosion, described as a "State-of-the-art Hypersonic Intercontinental Cruise," dominates the center of the panel.  The impact is depicted as a bright, expanding fireball.  To the right, a character (unidentified) is shown recoiling from the force of the blast, his face contorted in pain. The word "PUNCH!!" is prominently displayed to the left.  The scene suggests a powerful attack has been launched, resulting in widespread destruction.
