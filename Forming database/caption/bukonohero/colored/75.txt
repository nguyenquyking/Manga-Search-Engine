My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All For One and other characters discussing a data breach.  All For One, with his signature blonde hair and scarred face, is shown in multiple panels, explaining the situation.  Another character, possibly Sansa (mentioned in dialogue), is also present.  The discussion centers around a system shutdown caused by radio waves, linked to Shigaraki's actions. The panels show All For One’s analysis of the event and the unique nature of the system’s vulnerability.  The visual element of energy blasts is prominent.  A cat-like character is briefly shown earlier in the conversation.
