A large, monstrous, stone-like creature attacks a Japanese-style city.  The creature is partially visible, towering over buildings and a train track.  Several small human figures are visible on the street below, seemingly observing the destruction.  The scene is a wide shot, depicting multiple buildings, a train, and the giant creature in the background.  The text "Next chapter hits Sept. 6!" is present in the bottom right corner.  There are various signage on the buildings, including "Fitness Club" and Japanese script.
