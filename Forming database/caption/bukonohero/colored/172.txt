Here's a caption describing the provided manga image panels:  A fiery-haired hero, possibly Endeavor, stands amidst a rainy city scene.  He is engulfed in flames, and a text bubble indicates he's not affiliated with escaped convicts. Another panel shows a group of protesters in the street. Two blond-haired individuals observe the situation from a car, questioning the increased number of escaped convicts.  A panel shows Endeavor's fiery boots impacting the ground, sending a piece of debris flying. The overall tone suggests an urban crisis involving escaped prisoners and a powerful hero responding to the situation.
