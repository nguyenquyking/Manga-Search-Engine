Here's a detailed caption for the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  **Panel 1:** Two young boys, possibly younger versions of Bakugo and Midoriya, are walking in a forest.  Bakugo is ahead, carrying a net.  **Panel 2 & 3:**  A close-up shows Bakugo (Katsuki Bakugo) determined, stating "I'm not gonna lose..." and vowing to surpass even the "Chosen One," presumably referring to Midoriya (Izuku Midoriya), and making his own growth.  **Panel 4:** A dynamic action scene depicts Bakugo and Midoriya engaged in intense combat. Bakugo is launching a powerful explosive attack, while Midoriya is shown mid-air, seemingly using his quirk.  Midoriya is determined, saying "I can't afford to stay a loser!!"  The scene is filled with intense energy and motion lines.
