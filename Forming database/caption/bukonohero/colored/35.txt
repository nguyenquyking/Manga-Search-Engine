A dark, gritty manga panel depicts a battle scene.  A blonde-haired character, possibly All Might, lies defeated on the ground, groaning "ARGHHHH!!".  Several figures stand over him, including a man in a suit and a girl with yellow hair (possibly Toga Himiko).  Speech bubbles reveal thoughts of "KILL, KILL..." and "HAAATE THEM!!" alongside reassurances like "ALL WILL BE WELL" and "WORRY NOT, MY OTHER SELF".  The scene suggests a powerful character's defeat and internal struggle, with the visual style emphasizing darkness and distress. The overall tone is one of intense conflict and emotional turmoil.
