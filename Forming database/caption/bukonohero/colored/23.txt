A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between Spinner (a reptilian Heteromorph with a dark-colored outfit) and another character (likely a high-ranking member of the League of Villains, with dark hair and clothing). The dialogue reveals that Tomura Shigaraki is recovering, and the conversation centers on the large number of Heteromorphs (individuals with Quirks resulting in physical mutations) who harbor resentment towards heroes and the government. The scene highlights the societal prejudice against Heteromorphs and their significant presence within the criminal underworld.
