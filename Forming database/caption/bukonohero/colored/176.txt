A manga panel depicts a discussion between two characters.  One character, with blond hair and a dark mask partially obscuring their face, is shown in a close-up. The other character, with reddish-brown hair and a stern expression, is also shown in a close-up.  The speech bubbles reveal a strategic analysis of a situation involving supervillains from Tartarus, suggesting a coordinated attack. The conversation focuses on the villains' strategy of using chaos as cover while targeting "One for All."  The characters speculate on the heroes' weakened state and the primary goal of one villain, possibly hijacking Shigaraki.  The name "Deku" is mentioned in relation to the ongoing situation.
