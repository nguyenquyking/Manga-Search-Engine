This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a conversation between two characters.  A teacher, seemingly Hexamendle, discusses an incident with a younger student, who resembles Izuku Midoriya.  The conversation centers on an event that was broadcast on NHA, where the student's actions were deemed minor compared to All Might's usual villain encounters.  The teacher notes the student's appearance has improved since the incident, and expresses nervousness about interacting with the student directly at school.  A third character, possibly Mirko, is shown in another panel with a blonde-haired student, highlighting a connection to the main narrative.  The overall theme is reflection on a past incident and its aftermath.
