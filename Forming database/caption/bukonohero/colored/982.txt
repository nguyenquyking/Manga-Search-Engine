A group of My Hero Academia characters are shown in a school hallway.  A large, tan-clad character with a large head and a letter "F" on their chest dominates the foreground, expressing surprise ("What the heck...").  A smaller, dark-blue-clad character stands beside them.  In the background, several other characters, including a woman in a dark dress with light green hair, and others in less distinct attire, stand together, seemingly reacting to the central figures. A text bubble above them exclaims "Is this?!" The scene takes place in a modern building hallway.
