A manga panel depicting a confrontation between Midoriya, a severely injured hero with green hair, and a bloodied Endeavor.  Midoriya argues that Endeavor's actions contributed to the current state of affairs, where "evil is thriving" and "justice is losing this war."  A flashback shows a past event where an agent of justice performed vile acts, resulting in Midoriya's current state.  The overall tone is intense and accusatory.
