Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga-style comic panels:  **Panel 1 & 2:** A wide shot depicting the Mainland Gate (aka The Bronze Gate) at 8:34 PM. It's raining heavily, and the gate is a large, imposing structure under dim lighting.  **Panel 3 & 4:** Gyges, a character with ram-like horns, is shown in a close-up, seemingly engaged in a powerful action or attack, indicated by "BRAKKA" sound effects.  In a separate panel, a figure wearing a military-style cap sits at a control panel, urgently requesting a status report from Gyges and Briareos.
