Re-Destro, seated on a throne, addresses the Meta Liberation Army.  He declares himself Re-Destro and announces the army's rebirth.  Two other figures, presumably high-ranking members, are seated beside him. A large crowd of the Meta Liberation Army stands before them.  The scene is set in a grand hall or auditorium.
