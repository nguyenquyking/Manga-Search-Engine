A colossal, translucent blue figure, resembling a powerfully built man with long hair, dominates the scene.  This enormous figure is the result of air forming into a shape 1000 times larger than its original size.  A smaller figure, seemingly a blonde-haired woman, is shown in a panel above, reacting with a fierce expression to the giant figure's manifestation. Another, smaller panel shows a close-up of what appears to be the same blonde woman's terrified face from a different angle. Text indicates that the blue giant is performing a "Fist Bump" to the earth. A smaller figure, seemingly a warrior in gold and dark clothing, is shown perched atop a plane or similar object, observing the giant figure. The blonde woman's dialogue indicates that she warned of this event.
