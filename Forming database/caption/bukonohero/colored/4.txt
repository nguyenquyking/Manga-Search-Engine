A colossal, decaying figure is shown within a large, transparent, geometric structure. Three individuals observe from a rooftop. One character, with white hair and a sinister grin, declares, "...we're finished," implying the completion of a destructive act. The text indicates the activation of decay and the potential for a moment erasure to be undone if all participants are capable. The scene depicts a powerful, possibly apocalyptic event.
