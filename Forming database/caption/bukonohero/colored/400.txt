A manga panel depicting a female character, possibly a superhero, named Momo Yaoyorozu (based on visual similarity to the My Hero Academia character), in action.  She's wearing a white and black costume with technological elements, and is shown disengaging from several floating, rectangular devices labeled "ZERO SATELLITES!".  The word "FLOAT" is dynamically presented near her. She states, "I've shut those feelings away."  Smaller panels show her intensely focused, possibly recalling the moment she touched these devices while falling ("I touched all this stuff when I got knocked down.")  Another character, potentially her ally, confirms with, "Exactly!".  The overall scene suggests a powerful ability or technology being used in combat.
