One Piece manga panel depicting a fiery clash.  A character, possibly using a fire-based Devil Fruit power, creates a large explosion ("KASLAM") impacting a rocky surface. Another character, appearing to be dodging or reacting to the attack, is shown in a separate panel spinning with flames.  The scene is dynamic and filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia ("BWOOM").  Specific character names are not visible. The art style is colored and expressive.
