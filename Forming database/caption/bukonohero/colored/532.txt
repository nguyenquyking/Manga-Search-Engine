One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large explosion occurs ("BOOM"), seemingly caused by explosives planted underground by a female character with dark hair and a brown top (likely a named character, but not identifiable from the image alone).  Another character, a male with blond hair and facial injuries, comments "We're not done!" showing determination. A third character, seemingly a male with purple hair, wearing a turtle-like mask and dark clothing (likely a named character, but not identifiable from the image alone) expresses confidence about a plan.  The panel also shows a fourth character, partially visible, expressing concern about the explosives. The overall scene suggests a high-stakes confrontation, possibly underground, with the characters using strategic tactics.
