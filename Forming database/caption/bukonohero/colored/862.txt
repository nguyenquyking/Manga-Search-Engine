A colossal, red-haired figure, possibly a giant or monstrous character, unleashes a devastating attack, causing widespread destruction to a cityscape.  Buildings crumble, and several smaller figures are shown being thrown through the air by the force of the attack.  In the foreground, a character with long, white hair, possibly  All For One (from My Hero Academia), stands amidst the rubble, appearing battered and exhausted. A shadowy figure is visible in the background. The scene is one of intense chaos and destruction. The caption indicates the next chapter's release date: July 12th.
