One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle during the "Luna Arc".  A female character with white hair and a brown top, possibly a Lunarian, is shown mid-attack, creating a powerful shockwave marked "LUNA ARC!!".  She is severely injured and bleeding.  She appears to be striking or impacting a large machine or piece of technology.  In adjacent panels, an older, bald man with glasses and a mustache watches in apparent shock and glee, while another panel shows a progress bar indicating "COMPLETION STATUS 75%".  The style suggests intense action and possibly a technological element crucial to the plot.
