One Piece manga panel depicting a powerful attack.  A character, possibly an antagonist, with white hair and a fierce expression shouts "NOT ON MY WATCH," while unleashing a large-scale energy burst.  Text boxes indicate a need for support and a command to return to formation. The antagonist comments on the opponent's insufficient attack. The final panel shows a massive, bright energy explosion labeled "NOW, BURST."  The visual style is dynamic, emphasizing the intensity of the attack.
