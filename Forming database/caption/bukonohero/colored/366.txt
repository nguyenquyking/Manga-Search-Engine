A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a reunion between Endeavor (heavily scarred and wounded) and his son Shoto Todoroki (with fiery red and white hair).  Shoto, tearful but determined, urges his father to focus on protecting others while he and another unnamed hero (presumably Hawks) will fight.  The scene is intense, with flames and dynamic action lines suggesting a powerful battle.  Endeavor expresses disbelief at his son finding him alive.  The background shows a powerful, implied attack.
