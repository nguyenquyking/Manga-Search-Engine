A colored manga panel depicts a scene where several characters are discussing an incident involving the villain "Twice."  A screen shows a blurry image of two figures, possibly Twice and another individual.  A senior-looking man with gray hair, a yellow costume, and a black mask, possibly a hero, is central to the discussion. Another man, possibly a colleague, is present, along with a younger, green-haired character, possibly Izuku Midoriya, and another fair-haired individual.  The conversation centers around the villain's alliance and the investigation of a skirmish. The mood is serious and investigative.
