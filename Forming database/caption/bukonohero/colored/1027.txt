Two male students, one with blond hair and the other with green hair, stand in front of a multi-story building identified as "Sir's Offices," which is an hour away by train. The blond-haired student points towards the building, explaining that "Sir's got very strict standards." The green-haired student, initially surprised, reacts with a "Whoa..." and pushes back, saying "Don't get all square on me!"  The scene is set on a city street.
