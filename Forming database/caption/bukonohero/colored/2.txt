My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic scene with multiple characters.  Dynamight (a muscular blonde hero) engages in a heated exchange with a rabbit-eared hero (likely Miruko), who is launching a powerful attack.  Another hero, Eraserhead, observes Midoriya making contact with a villain, while a third hero, possibly Present Mic, assures Eraserhead of his competence.  The scene is action-packed, highlighting the collaborative effort of the heroes against a common threat.
