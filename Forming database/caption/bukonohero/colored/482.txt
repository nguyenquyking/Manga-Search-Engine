Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dynamic manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  Todoroki, engulfed in flames, is shown in close-up, his face contorted in exertion.  Above, a powerful figure with spiky blonde hair and a menacing grin attacks, seemingly unstoppable. Below, a character (possibly a supporting hero) observes, noting Todoroki's reduced fire power and speculating about blowback from his attacks. The final panel shows a powerful impact, marked "SLAM," suggesting a significant physical attack landing.  The overall scene conveys intense action and dramatic tension.
