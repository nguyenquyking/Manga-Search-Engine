A colored manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Endeavor (in his fiery, activated form) unleashes a powerful, intense blast of fire, striking an opponent who "...gives up!!"  The impact is emphasized by large "FA KOOM" onomatopoeia.  A subsequent panel shows a defeated character, possibly implying the end of the fight.  The text "Next chapter hits Apr. 12!" indicates a continuation.  The colorist's credit, "Colorist HEXAMENDLEY," is also present.
