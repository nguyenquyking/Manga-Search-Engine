A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a strategic discussion and a character's determination.  The scene shows multiple panels:  one with a character, possibly a UA staff member, confirming the strategy against Toga; another shows a determined character, possibly a student, vowing payback; a third shows a nighttime exterior shot of UA High School; and finally, a close-up of a blond character, possibly All Might, seemingly reacting to the rain. The dialogue focuses on the limitations of Toga's quirk and the effectiveness of the UA's containment strategy.  The overall mood is serious and tense.
