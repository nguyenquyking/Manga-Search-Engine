One Piece manga panel depicting a blonde woman, possibly a character with a US-themed outfit, launching a projectile resembling a missile.  Simultaneously, a large, dark vessel in the background is emitting powerful energy blasts, creating a large explosion in the water below. The woman's attack and the vessel's energy beams are depicted with dynamic lines and onomatopoeia ("FSHAA"). The scene suggests a confrontation or battle at sea.
