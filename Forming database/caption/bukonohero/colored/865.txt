Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  Dabi, severely scarred and wielding intensely blue flames, dominates the panel.  Text indicates he has already defeated two opponents, who are shown bloodied and injured in smaller panels below.  One defeated opponent appears to be Shoto Todoroki.  Another, blonde-haired, is also shown injured. In the bottom panel, Dabi continues his attack, with a female character briefly visible in the background, seemingly falling.  The overall scene depicts intense battle and Dabi's overwhelming power.
