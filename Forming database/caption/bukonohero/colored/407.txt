A manga panel depicting a massive monster causing widespread destruction in a city.  The monster, with large mole-like claws, is tossing buildings aside.  People are fleeing the devastation.  One panel shows a figure in a red suit assessing the unprecedented damage. Text indicates an evacuation within a 5km radius is necessary, and the monster's arrival is imminent (8 minutes).  Another panel highlights the moral dilemma of saving lives at the cost of the responders' own, contrasting with the innocent civilians caught in the disaster. The overall tone expresses urgency and a sense of failure in preventing the catastrophe.
