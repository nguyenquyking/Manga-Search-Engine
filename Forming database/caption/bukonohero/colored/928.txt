A manga panel depicting a conversation between three characters:  Nighteye, a man with spiky green hair, and two other men, one in a suit and the other with grey hair.  Nighteye is visibly concerned, while the suited man (presumably Nighteye's mentor) ponders a hypothetical situation involving death.  The third character, an older man with a partially obscured face, is also present. The scene focuses on philosophical discussion regarding the implications of All Might's legacy and the potential impact of imminent death.
