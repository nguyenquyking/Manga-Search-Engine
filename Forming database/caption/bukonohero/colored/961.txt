My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion among characters about a villain's actions.  A powerful villain, seemingly All For One, is shown extracting what appears to be bullets from a captured, light-green haired female Quirk user.  Uraraka Ochaco, Iida Tenya, and Bakugo Katsuki are shown reacting to this information, expressing concern and speculating about the villain's motives. The discussion centers around whether the villain is using the extracted material to create weapons or is trafficking them for profit.  A fourth character, possibly a teacher or analyst, is seen in the final panel, summarizing the situation and highlighting the lack of definitive proof. The overall tone is one of serious analysis and uncertainty regarding the villain's plans.
