My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation between Izuku Midoriya and Sir Nighteye.  Midoriya, visibly frustrated, contemplates countering Nighteye's Foresight Quirk, which allows him to see an opponent's moves for the next hour by touching them and making eye contact.  Nighteye, condescendingly, calls Midoriya "utterly mediocre" despite acknowledging his possession of the "symbol's power." The panel also shows a narration box explaining Nighteye's Quirk's mechanics and foreshadowing an increase in villain activity.
