Here's a caption describing the provided image:  A rain-soaked scene depicts several My Hero Academia characters standing in a somber arrangement.  Bakugo, head bowed, stands centrally, a speech bubble above him reading, "I'm sorry for everything."  Characters including Kirishima, Todoroki, and others stand around him, seemingly observing his apology. The overall mood is one of remorse and tension.  The setting is a wet, brick-paved area under a heavy downpour.
