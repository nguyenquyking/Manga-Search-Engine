One Piece manga panel depicting a narrative scene. A character with a spiky, light-colored hairstyle, possibly a villain given the context clues, is shown interacting with a larger, bald individual. The smaller character's narration describes feeling ostracized and wretched until the larger figure reached out. The larger character is described as having an overwhelming presence and a Buddha-like smile, causing the smaller character to feel disgust.  The smaller character presented their "Quirk" (possibly a power or ability) as an offering. The scene suggests a power dynamic and possibly a reluctant alliance.
