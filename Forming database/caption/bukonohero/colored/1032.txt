A manga panel depicting a tense scene. A stern-faced man with dark green and blond hair, wearing glasses, is shown in the foreground. He appears to be reacting to the events unfolding in the background. In the background, a smaller panel shows two students, possibly Bubble Girl and another sidekick, looking surprised.  A distressed, pale-skinned female character with dark, curly hair is shown in a separate panel, seemingly overwhelmed. The main focus is on the man's determination as he resolves to get stronger, indicated by his internal monologue and intense facial expression.  Izuku Midoriya (also known as Deku) is shown in another panel, experiencing a powerful surge of energy or intensity. The overall scene suggests a significant turning point in the narrative, with the man preparing to take action and Deku facing a challenge.
