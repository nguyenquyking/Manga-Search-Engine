A manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene followed by character dialogue.  A centaur-like figure, possibly a villain, is shown mid-leap, its body powerful and brown, launching projectiles (possibly pineapples) while a text bubble above reads "CENTAUR!". Below, smaller figures are shown reacting to the attack.  The subsequent panels show a close-up of Sun Eater, a horned character with dark hair and a determined expression,  requesting others to stand down.  Another character, a round figure in yellow, is shown in a separate panel, reacting to the events.  Sun Eater's dialogue box identifies him as a sidekick at Fat Gum's agency, starting next year.  The overall scene is energetic and suggests a battle or confrontation.
