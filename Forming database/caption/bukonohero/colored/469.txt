Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dynamic action scene depicting a fierce battle between two characters.  The top panel shows a large explosion of ice shards, labeled "SMASH," indicating a powerful attack. The second panel shows a close-up of the combat, with one character (presumably Izuku Midoriya/Deku) in a green costume using a green energy attack on a larger, dark-haired character (likely All Might).  The bottom panels show close-ups of both characters' faces, visibly injured and distressed.  The injured dark-haired character cries out "Sensei!!" twice, while the green-suited character cries out "Urgh..." indicating pain and exertion.  The overall scene suggests a desperate struggle and the potential defeat of one character.
