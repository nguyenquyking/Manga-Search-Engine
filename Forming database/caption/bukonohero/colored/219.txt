A manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  A woman with dark hair, revealing she is Tomura Shigaraki's grandmother, expresses remorse and shame for her actions, particularly burdening her 16-year-old grandson, Tomura Shigaraki (partially obscured by a dark, glowing aura), with her past failures in their fight against All For One. The visual style uses dark tones and dramatic lighting to emphasize the emotional weight of the scene.
