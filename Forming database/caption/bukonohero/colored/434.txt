Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  Hexamendle, a character with vibrant green hair and a dark mask, is depicted amidst a powerful, teal energy burst.  He appears to be in motion, possibly teleporting or using a powerful ability.  The scene is dynamic, with radiating energy lines and a dark, shadowy effect surrounding him.  The second panel shows a dark, ominous abyss, possibly a location Hexamendle has arrived at. The text "THIS PLACE..." suggests a reaction to the new environment.
