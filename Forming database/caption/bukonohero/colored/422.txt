He is engaged in aerial combat with Shoto Todoroki, who uses ice powers.  A lower panel shows a close-up of a brutal hand-to-hand fight between Todoroki and another character, possibly Katsuki Bakugo (although his face is not clearly visible), with intense motion lines indicating powerful blows and significant blood splatter.  The final panel shows Todoroki and another severely injured character (possibly Bakugo) amidst the wreckage of the battle.  The overall scene emphasizes the intensity and brutality of the fight, with text expressing regret over the violence.
