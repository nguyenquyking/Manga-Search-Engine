A manga panel depicting a serious scene.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku), cloaked in a shimmering, dark green energy, stands before two other figures.  One figure, seemingly older and in a high-backed chair, observes Midoriya with a concerned expression. The other figure, partially obscured, is also present.  The dialogue reveals that Midoriya's power, One For All, is exceptionally difficult to wield, and that the circumstances surrounding the death of a predecessor are being discussed. The overall mood is somber and intense.  The visual style emphasizes the power and mystery surrounding One For All.
