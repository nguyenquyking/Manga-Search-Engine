Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A close-up depicts a dramatic battle scene.  A female character, possibly Nejire Hado, in a dark dress and boots,  has just deflected an energy blast aimed at Izuku Midoriya (Deku). Midoriya, visibly injured and with a determined expression, is shown in a smaller panel below. The panel shows a large, bloody, and partially disintegrated limb, suggesting a powerful attack.  Text bubbles reveal dialogue between the characters, highlighting the near-miss and implications of potential alliances.  The overall scene is intense and action-packed.
