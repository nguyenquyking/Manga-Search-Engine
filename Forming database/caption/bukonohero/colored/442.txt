A manga panel depicts a severely injured Izuku Midoriya (Deku) unleashing a powerful attack.  His face is contorted in exertion, blood covers his body, and green energy surges around him.  He declares this power is for his dreams.  In another panel, he's shown engaging in intense combat with a heavily injured, light-skinned opponent, using a green energy-based attack. The opponent appears to be significantly weaker, possibly overwhelmed.  The text bubbles reveal Midoriya's determination and frustration due to his physical limitations and the actions of "scummy heroes."
