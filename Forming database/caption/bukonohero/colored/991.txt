A colored manga panel depicts a tense confrontation.  Izuku Midoriya, identifiable by his green hair and hero costume, is shown from the shoulders up, his expression grim. He's questioning someone off-panel, his words "What are you doing to her?".  Another panel shows a hand pulling at his costume.  A third panel shows a blond-haired hero, possibly a supporting character, with a yellow visor, confidently declaring "We're heroes!". The overall scene suggests a rescue or intervention, with Midoriya concerned about a frightened child.
