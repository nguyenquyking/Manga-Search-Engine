My Hero Academia chapter 278 shows a massive, earth-like creature grabbing a female hero (likely Mt. Lady) in its hand.  A large explosion is visible in the background. In a separate panel, Dabi,  Todoroki, and another character are observing the scene, commenting on the scale of the event and the need to remain hidden.  The text indicates the "boss" has awakened, and the situation is unfolding more rapidly than anticipated.  Smaller panels depict other heroes reacting to the chaos.
