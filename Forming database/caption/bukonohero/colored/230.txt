My Hero Academia Chapter 304 depicts a council-like gathering.  Several characters, including Izuku Midoriya (partially visible, in a green energy form), are seated in ornate chairs around a central fire.  Other identifiable characters include a white-haired individual, and a dark-haired character in a dark suit.  The scene suggests a serious discussion or impending event, with dialogue hinting at a pre-awakening conversation.  The overall mood is tense and anticipatory.
