A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  All Might, severely injured, is shown in a close-up, his expression grim.  He's delivering a powerful statement, "It's made everyone suffer," indicating the suffering caused by his actions or existence.  The panel also shows a flashback of a conversation judging All Might's actions. Another panel showcases a powerful energy blast, possibly emitted by All Might, engulfing another character (unclear if it is a hero or villain).  The overall tone is dark and serious, focusing on the consequences of All Might's actions and the weight of his decisions.
