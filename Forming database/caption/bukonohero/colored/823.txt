A manga panel depicting a powerful dark purple energy emanating from a large, shadowy figure, possibly a Devil Fruit user, labeled "Stress: 100 Percent".  The energy is causing destruction, indicated by the crumbling ground.  A smaller figure, possibly a fighter, is shown resisting or being affected by the energy. The word "CRUMBLE" is emphasized twice within the panel.  The large figure appears to be using a dark, powerful energy attack.  The smaller figure's expression suggests intense strain or struggle. The overall scene suggests a dramatic battle with significant power disparity.
