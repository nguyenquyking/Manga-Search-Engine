Close-up manga panel depicting two characters experiencing intense fear or distress.  One character, with blond hair, displays wide, fearful eyes and sweat. The other character, with dark green hair, shows similar expressions of fear and sweat, and a bandaged arm crackling with purple energy. The panels emphasize their facial expressions and the purple energy emanating from the bandaged arm.  The Japanese onomatopoeia suggests a powerful energy release or impact. The overall tone is one of suspense and impending danger.
