A group of people stand in the rain, having abandoned their homes seeking safety, questioning the Principal's explanation for a ticking time bomb.  A young man, possibly Izuku Midoriya, is shown separately, walking away in the rain, his expression distraught. Another individual, possibly Ida, is implied to be involved in linking a chain. A young woman, possibly Ochaco Uraraka, comforts him, saying "Hey, it's okay."  The scene is dark and somber, rain falling heavily.  The overall tone expresses fear, confusion, and concern.
