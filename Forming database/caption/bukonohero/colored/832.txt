One Piece manga panel depicting a powerful scene. A man with white hair is shown undergoing a transformation, surrounded by dark, swirling energy. Text bubbles indicate a significant power increase ("One hundred and fifty percent, huh?") and a transition beyond pain ("Past the pain... Beyond this awakening...").  Another character, seemingly armored and partially visible, observes, commenting on the transformation as "liberation," not suppression.  A third character, with red eyes and sharp features, is also partially visible, observing the event.  The dialogue suggests a powerful ability release, possibly related to a "Plus Ultra" concept.
