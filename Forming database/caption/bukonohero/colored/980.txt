My Hero Academia students, including Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, Ochaco Uraraka, and Tsuyu Asui, are shown in several panels.  The first panel depicts them coincidentally meeting at the same train station. Subsequent panels show them walking down the same street, noting the coincidental similarities in their routes. The final panel introduces additional characters, likely members of the "Big 3,"  with one character, seemingly Denki Kaminari, greeting the group.  The overall scene emphasizes the unexpected convergence of these characters.
