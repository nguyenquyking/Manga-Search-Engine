A manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A large, round character in a beige jacket with an "F" on it apologizes for an incident involving a handgun discharge.  Another character, seemingly a police officer, explains the situation, highlighting the unusual nature of the bullet's disintegration due to a quirk.  A red-haired young man, possibly a hero-in-training, is shown expressing concern and self-doubt about his own abilities, while a cloaked figure appears to be comforting or observing him.  The dialogue reveals a discussion about the young man's performance, comparing him to another hero known as Mirio. The scene emphasizes the contrast between the experienced officer's calm assessment and the younger hero's emotional response.
