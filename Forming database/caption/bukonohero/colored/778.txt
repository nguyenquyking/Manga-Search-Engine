My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation between Tomura Shigaraki and a blond-haired hero (likely a pro hero). Shigaraki uses his Decay quirk, generating a large, swirling blue wave of energy that engulfs the hero, who is knocked back and seemingly defeated.  Shigaraki comments on the hero's apparent defeat, while the hero is shown in a subsequent panel, seemingly unfazed, and able to hear Shigaraki clearly.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia, emphasizing the power of Shigaraki's attack. The final panel shows text indicating the next chapter release date.
