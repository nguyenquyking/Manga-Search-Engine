One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with two distinct parts.  The upper panel shows a monstrous figure with white hair, seemingly composed of numerous hands, speaking to an unseen audience. The figure's dialogue expresses contempt for those who avoid the inevitable future.  The lower panel shows a female character, possibly a cyborg, running towards a building, exclaiming "I need some spares!"  She appears to be in a hurry.  The building resembles a small, metallic structure with compartments.  The overall scene suggests a fast-paced action sequence with a looming sense of impending doom.
