Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  **Panel Description:**  A two-panel manga spread featuring Izuku Midoriya (top panel) and Tomura Shigaraki (bottom panel).  Midoriya displays a shocked and fearful expression, his speech bubble reading "It's...". Shigaraki, with a sinister grin and glowing red eye, is shown from the chest up against an orange-red background, his speech bubble stating "...down there." The visual contrast highlights the intense confrontation between the two characters.  The art style is consistent with the My Hero Academia manga series.
