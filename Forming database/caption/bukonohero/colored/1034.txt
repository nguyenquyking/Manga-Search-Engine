Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A close-up of a stern-faced character, possibly a teacher or authority figure, wearing glasses and a collared shirt, dominates the top panel.  A speech bubble above him reads, "ARE YOU MOCKING ALL MIGHT?!"  Below, two smaller panels show  reactions to an apparent failure.  One panel depicts a surprised, wide-eyed blonde character, possibly a student, with speech bubbles reading "IS THIS THE PINK SLIP FOR HIS INTERNSHIP?" and "IT BOMBED!". The other panel shows a distraught, sweating green-haired character, also seemingly a student, reacting with visible distress.  The overall scene suggests a tense moment of confrontation and disappointment following a failed event.
