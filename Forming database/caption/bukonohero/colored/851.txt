A manga panel depicting a young boy with white hair, possibly Shoto Todoroki, experiencing intense internal conflict.  He's shown with a pained expression and a glowing, fiery image on his chest, representing negative emotions. The text bubbles indicate these emotions stem from the deaths of his grandparents and mother.  A man, possibly his father, observes him from a distance in a previous panel, commenting on the resilience of the human heart.  The image juxtaposes the boy's internal turmoil with his father's observation, highlighting the theme of grief and emotional suppression.  The earlier panels show disembodied hands representing his family members.
