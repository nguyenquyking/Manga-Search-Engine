Manga panel depicting a discussion about One For All, a quirk in My Hero Academia. The focus is on Shigaraki's rage and its role in inheriting One For All.  The panels show text-heavy dialogue boxes explaining that One For All requires a strong body and a strong emotion, specifically intense hatred, to be successfully wielded.  The discussion questions whether Shigaraki's rage is sufficient, and whether previous users relied on hatred to control the quirk's power.  A blond character, possibly Shigaraki or a successor, is prominently featured in several panels. The panels include internal monologue and dialogue between unseen characters.
