One Piece manga panel depicting a tense discussion.  A muscular, dark-haired young man, possibly Izuku Midoriya (though not explicitly stated), confronts a burly older man in olive drab clothing.  The younger man declares, "A man's gotta protect his hometown!" while the older man recounts a past event where he fought off attackers, stating, "When they came for my shop, I gave those suckers a taste of their own medicine."  Background panels show a group of civilians looking apprehensive, suggesting an impending threat.  The dialogue indicates a disagreement about the best course of action, with the younger man advocating for proactive defense.  The presence of "Nomu" is mentioned, indicating a potentially dangerous situation.
