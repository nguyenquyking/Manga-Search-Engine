A manga panel depicts a character with white hair and a mustache,  using his Quirk, "Gently Rebound," to launch a smaller, green-haired character away. The larger character explains his Quirk allows him to bestow elasticity to anything he touches, using air as an example.  The smaller character is surprised by the sudden movement, shown in a separate panel. The text includes onomatopoeia such as "BOING" and "GWO."  The scene suggests a battle or demonstration of power.
