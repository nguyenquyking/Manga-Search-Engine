A colossal, muscular figure, possibly a Titan or giant, carries several smaller figures on its back amidst a cloud of dust and debris.  One of the smaller figures appears to be a blonde woman with a distressed expression and what looks like blood on her face. The giant's face is partially visible and shows a fierce expression.  In a separate panel, a shorter female character with dark hair and a determined look comments on the giant's size, comparing it to Mt. Lady. In another panel, a male character, possibly injured, is shown with a surprised and slightly embarrassed expression, commenting on his current situation. The overall scene depicts intense action and possibly a battle or struggle.
