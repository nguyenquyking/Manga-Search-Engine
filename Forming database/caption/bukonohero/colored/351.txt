Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga-style image:  **Caption:**  A dynamic action scene featuring Lemillion (blonde hair) in mid-air, launching a powerful attack that creates large ice shards, striking several dark-cloaked figures.  Another panel shows a smaller, blonde-haired figure buried in the ground, labeled "PO-".  Izuku Midoriya (green hair), seemingly injured and bloodied, is shown in a separate panel with the text "LEMILLION!" above him.  The overall style mimics a dynamic manga fight sequence.
