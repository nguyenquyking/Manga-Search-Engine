A manga panel depicting a fiery blue energy blast emanating from a character, possibly Shoto Todoroki, engulfing other characters in a city street.  Todoroki, identifiable by his dual-colored hair and scar, is shown unleashing a powerful ice-blue attack, creating a large, dynamic explosion.  Other, smaller figures are caught within the blast, seemingly injured or incapacitated.  Text bubbles indicate the intensity of the attack ("That's burning hot!!") and a dialogue between Todoroki and possibly an unseen opponent ("More importantly, let's chat while we have this chance.").  The scene is highly energetic and visually striking due to the dynamic energy effects and contrasting colors.
