A manga comic panel depicting a narrative about a character's life and death.  The scene shows a character with white hair and purple markings, revealing cracks on his face and narrating his story. The narrative focuses on his long struggle to master "One For All", his decision to dedicate his life to gaining strength, and his eventual death due to the strain of possessing multiple Quirks.  A second character with bright green hair is briefly shown in a separate panel reacting with surprise ("Huh?"). The overall tone suggests a serious and reflective moment, potentially a flashback or explanation of past events. The name "HEXAMENDLE" is visible in a watermark, possibly indicating the source.
