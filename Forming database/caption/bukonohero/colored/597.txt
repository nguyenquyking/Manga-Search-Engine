Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A manga panel depicting a scene where a character with white hair and red eyes, seemingly possessing a powerful Quirk, comments on the data obtained from previous users of the Quirk. The text explains that the Quirk "Search" reveals the location and weaknesses of anyone the user has seen.  Another panel shows a character with teal hair and gold-colored accessories, likely the current user of the Quirk. The top panel shows a figure falling from a great height amidst a purple, destructive energy.  The overall tone suggests a sinister power and a potentially dangerous consequence of the Quirk.
