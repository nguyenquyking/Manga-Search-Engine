Manga panel depicting a dynamic fight scene.  A green-haired character, possibly Izuku Midoriya, executes a swift aerial attack ("From Above," "Into another assault") using what appears to be electricity-based power, indicated by blue energy effects.  He's shown overwhelming an opponent with a flurry of quick movements ("I'll overwhelm him with a flurry of moves").  The opponent, partially visible, seems to be wearing glasses and a white uniform. The scene showcases speed and power, with onomatopoeia ("WH," "IFF") emphasizing the impact and swiftness of the attacks. The text "I see all" suggests the attacker's awareness and control over the battle.  The style is consistent with shonen manga action sequences.
