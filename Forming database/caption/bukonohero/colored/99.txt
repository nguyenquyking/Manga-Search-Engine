Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  Two characters, possibly heroes, are shown in action.  The first panel depicts two figures, one with spiky red hair and the other with dark hair, seemingly discussing a joint operation.  A subsequent panel shows a large-scale battle scene, with numerous individuals exhibiting various powers and abilities.  Among the participants are Kirishima (red hair) and another character with dark hair.  Kirishima is praised for his strategic positioning during the engagement.  The narrative suggests the action is not related to special powers. The overall tone suggests a coordinated team effort within a dynamic conflict.
