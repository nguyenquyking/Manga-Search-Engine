A manga panel depicting a nighttime scene.  A black car speeds through city streets (top panels).  Inside the car, a conversation takes place between two characters. One,  presumably Night-Eye, is shown from the side, concerned about the other character's lack of sleep. The other character, whose name is not explicitly mentioned, is shown in various panels, seeming tired but continuing their mission ("still on the move").  Night-Eye suggests rest, implying concern for the characterâ€™s well-being. The overall mood is serious and urgent.
