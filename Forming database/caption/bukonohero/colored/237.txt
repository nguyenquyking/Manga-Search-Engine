A manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  A young, green-haired character (possibly Izuku Midoriya) expresses disbelief ("O ay! (No way!)").  An older, white-haired character (likely All Might) responds,  with a narrative box explaining that only All Might could handle One For All for an extended period.  Another panel shows a fiery figure, possibly representing the immense power of One For All.  A chained, dark-haired individual is also present, listening. The narrative focuses on the physical burden of One For All and the consequences for previous users.
