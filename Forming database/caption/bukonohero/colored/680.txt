One Piece manga panel depicting Hexamendle, a character with blond hair and glasses, recounting the past reception of his "Paranormal Singularity Theory."  The theory was initially dismissed as irrational nonsense due to weak evidence.  Now, years later, the theory is considered fringe and associated with cults.  A second character, an older, bald man, is shown reacting to Hexamendle's explanation.  A third panel shows a figure in a lab coat, possibly representing a scholar who later presented the theory before disappearing. The narrative focuses on the theory's evolution from disregard to fringe status.
