A manga-style comic panel depicts a scene where a character with bright green hair, possibly Izuku Midoriya (One for All), interacts with the vestiges of his predecessors.  The predecessors, previously only accessible through fleeting consciousness, are now able to communicate directly.  One predecessor, shown seated on a throne, is visible.  A central panel displays a glowing orb representing the One for All power, which has grown rapidly in the past four months, allowing for this enhanced interaction.  The overall scene suggests a significant power increase and a deeper connection with the past users of One for All.
