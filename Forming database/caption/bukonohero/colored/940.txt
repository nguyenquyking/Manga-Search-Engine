A colored manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A man with dark hair and a bird-like mask, possibly a villain, is seen in one panel, stating he needs to be someone Eri can trust and to give her candy.  In another panel, a young girl with long green hair, possibly Eri, lies in bed looking thoughtful. A green-suited figure, potentially a hero, is partially visible, implying a connection with the girl.  The text bubbles express the man's intentions and the girl's feelings of being held like never before.  Another panel shows a blonde man in a white coat, seemingly making a comment on the situation.  The overall mood is a mix of suspense and tenderness.
