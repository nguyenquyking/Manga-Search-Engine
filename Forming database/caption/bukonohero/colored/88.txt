A panel from a manga depicting a tearful Izuku Midoriya, his face streaked with rain, clutching his injured hand. He's surrounded by rain and  declares, "We'll bring it all back."  In the panel above, a group including Katsuki Bakugo, Eijiro Kirishima, and others stand together, seemingly supporting Midoriya. The text implies a shared determination and a difficult situation.  The overall mood is somber yet resolute.
