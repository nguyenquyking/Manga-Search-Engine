A multi-panel manga comic depicting a scene with several characters.  A man with blond hair and a sinister grin is shown in the first panel, seemingly pleased with something.  The subsequent panels show various characters reacting, including a group observing a scene, a person seemingly recovering from injuries, and a conversation between a recovered individual and a doctor-like figure.  The dialogue reveals a character, Machia, has been tamed, and another character is pleased with a new, less tacky name. The overall tone is one of success following a difficult situation, with a focus on Machia's recovery and a new identity.  Specific character names are not discernible from the image alone, but the presence of Doc Ujiko is mentioned in the dialogue.
