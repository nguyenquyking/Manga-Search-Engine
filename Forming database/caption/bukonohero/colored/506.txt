One Piece manga panel depicting a giant, muscular humanoid figure, possibly a creature or enemy, using a powerful, blue energy attack.  Smaller figures, seemingly a group of allies, are shown being held in the giant's hand, described as "gnats." The giant is shown issuing a command to its comrades to "hold on tight" as the attack begins, and a defeated foe is seen in the background. The overall scene suggests a large-scale battle with a significant power difference between the combatants.
