A manga panel depicting a tense conversation between two characters.  A blond character, appearing to be a superhero with a US-themed costume, grins confidently. They are speaking to a darker-skinned character in a suit, who appears to be an official or authority figure. The blond character's actions indicate approval of an impending "strike," potentially a planned action or attack. The dialogue boxes reveal a discussion regarding consequences, preparedness, and the defiance of rules.  The overall mood is one of anticipation and impending conflict.
