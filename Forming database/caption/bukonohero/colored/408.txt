A manga panel depicting a group of heroes monitoring an approaching enemy force.  A character with long black hair observes a satellite image showing approaching heroes on a computer screen, commenting on the "handy" satellite image.  Another character, seemingly a female with short blonde hair, orders a long-haired character to zoom in on the satellite image. The scene also shows a group of heroes in a desert-like setting,  observing the approaching enemy. The overall tone suggests strategic planning and awareness of an imminent confrontation.
