A large wave of ice, labeled "KASHNK," crashes down, destroying a wooden structure. A character, possibly a male, with dark hair is seen riding a blue wave-like energy, seemingly escaping the destruction. Another, smaller figure is shown clinging to the collapsing structure, expressing surprise ("?!").  Multiple figures are falling or being swept away by the ice wave in the lower section of the image. The scene is depicted with dynamic action lines emphasizing the powerful impact of the ice wave.  The art style suggests a manga or comic book aesthetic.
