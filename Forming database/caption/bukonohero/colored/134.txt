My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a group of heroes strategizing.  The scene shows a conversation between several characters, including Mirko (a rabbit-like hero) who questions Midoriya's (Deku's) silent approach.  Other heroes present include Endeavor (a fire-based hero) who expresses concern about a lack of resources (heroes and police) and the necessity of public action to find leads.  The setting is a dark, warehouse-like space, snowing lightly. The panel highlights the strategic tension and resource constraints faced by the heroes.
