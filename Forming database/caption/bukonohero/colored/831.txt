A manga panel depicting a powerful ice-based attack.  A red-haired character, possibly a protagonist, performs a "Swing" attack, smashing through a structure and creating a large ice wave.  Other characters react in shock and fear, with text indicating they must protect "Re-Destro." A green-skinned character exclaims "Whoa!"  In the bottom panel, a close-up shows a powerful figure, potentially a villain, referred to as "Master's Successor," with ice shards emanating from their attack. The scene is chaotic and dynamic, suggesting a major confrontation.
