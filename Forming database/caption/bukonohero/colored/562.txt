My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku) and Katsuki Bakugo are facing off against a powerful, unnamed, muscular, pale-skinned villain. The villain is creating a powerful earth-based attack ("SHOOM"). Bakugo, engulfed in flames, is preparing to counter-attack, while Midoriya is implied to be elsewhere and is the focus of Bakugo's protective statement ("You cover Deku!!").  The scene highlights the dynamic between the two heroes and their collaborative effort against a common enemy.
