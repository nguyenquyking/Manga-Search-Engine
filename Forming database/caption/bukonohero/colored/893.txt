Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  Izuku Midoriya, screaming "AHHHH!!", is being attacked by a dark, shadowy figure emitting dark energy.  In the subsequent panels, Midoriya, using his One for All quirk, fights back against a monstrous, dark-red, tentacled creature.  Another character, possibly a villain, is seen maneuvering amidst the creature's appendages.  The overall scene is filled with dynamic action and electric energy effects.
