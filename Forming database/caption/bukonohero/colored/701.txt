A manga panel depicting a tense battle scene.  The central figure is a dark-haired hero, possibly Eraser Head,  straining against overwhelming force, his face partially obscured by bandages and goggles. He's using his quirk but is struggling against opponents with superior strength. Text indicates the enemies are shrugging off his attacks with ease.  Mirko is mentioned, suggesting she's part of the team and backup is en route.  Other heroes, possibly Eraser Head's team, are instructed to proceed ahead while he holds back the enemy. The background shows a chaotic scene with numerous villains on the ground.  The overall mood is one of desperation and urgency.
