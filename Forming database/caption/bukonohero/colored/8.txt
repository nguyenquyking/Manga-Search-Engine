A manga panel depicting a battle scene. A muscular, dark-skinned man with red markings is impaled by numerous ice shards, his expression one of shock and pain.  The text "FLESH" appears above him. In a separate panel, a character in dark clothing, seemingly a villain, is attacked and  a blade snaps.  Text indicates the need to capture escaped convicts. Another panel shows a surprised, happy female character with green hair (likely Tsuyu Asui/Froppy) reacting to a shockwave. A blue-haired female character (likely another hero) is also shown, and text mentions Froppy's attack reaching the rear guard. The overall scene suggests a fight against a powerful villain who has enhanced numerous individuals with quirks.
