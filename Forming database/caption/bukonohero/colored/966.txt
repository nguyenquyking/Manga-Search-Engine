My Hero Academia manga chapter 134, "Show Your Guts, Red Riot!", depicts Eijiro Kirishima in his hardened, rock-like form, powerfully stating "They'll never take me down!!!"  He is shown amidst a flurry of action lines suggesting intense combat.  Another panel shows a character (possibly an opponent) whose face is obscured,  experiencing a "grating" sensation, indicating the effectiveness of Kirishima's attack.  The time limit of Kirishima's transformation is also mentioned.  The overall scene is dynamic and highlights Kirishima's strength and determination.
