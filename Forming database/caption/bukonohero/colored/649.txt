Machia, a character with long, flowing white hair and red eyes, is shown smiling menacingly while holding a den den mushi (a snail-like communication device).  He's giving instructions, saying "To me, Machia. And bring the others."  The scene is set against a light blue, cloud-filled sky.  The overall tone suggests anticipation and a sense of impending action.
