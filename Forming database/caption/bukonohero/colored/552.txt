A manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Multiple characters engage in combat, with energy blasts and significant impact effects shown.  One character, seemingly a large, muscular man, is shown creating a large dust cloud as he runs, possibly indicating a powerful attack or escape.  Other characters, including Momo Yao, are shown reacting to the situation, with dialogue indicating confusion and a need for a plan.  The overall scene suggests a desperate situation, possibly a retreat.  The text "HEXAMENDLE" is visible in the top panel.
