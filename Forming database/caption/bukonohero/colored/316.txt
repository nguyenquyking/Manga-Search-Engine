One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a bound individual, possibly a prisoner or unwilling participant, is shown from the waist up, tightly wrapped in dark gray restraints.  The individual's skin is dark brown.  A red "POP" sound effect indicates a recent impact or release of pressure.  Beside this panel, a gloved hand, clad in red, is seen manipulating a swirling blue energy. This character is speaking, with speech bubbles indicating the need for a "good assistant" for a "decent performance".  The bound individual's speech bubble reveals their motivation:  "My dream... my blood... bound duty... the reason I'm here!"  The overall visual style is dark and intense, with strong contrasts between light and shadow.
