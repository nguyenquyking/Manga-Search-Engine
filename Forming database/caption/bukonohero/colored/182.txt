A manga panel depicts a confrontation between two characters. A villain, seemingly targeting a green-suited hero, addresses the hero with "Hey, you, boy in green...". The hero, in a teal and yellow costume, stands on a rooftop, seemingly aware of the villainâ€™s presence. The villain's dialogue boxes indicate a pursuit, stating "Someone's here for me!!" and "They're specifically after me!!". The villain also threatens the hero, stating "You're coming with me."  The scene is set on a rainy rooftop, with the action emphasized by motion lines. The visual style is dark and gritty.  An escapee with ties to the hero is also mentioned.
