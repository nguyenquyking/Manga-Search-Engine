A manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a young woman with long white hair, appearing concerned.  Next, Best Jeanist and Hawks are shown, injured and bandaged.  A subsequent panel shows a hospital room with several individuals, including a blonde man with bandages, who explains he’s been gathering intel since his discharge.  Another panel shows the blonde man, seemingly apologetic, interacting with two others, one of whom is kneeling. The final panel focuses on the kneeling person and their conversation suggesting an inquiry about Dabi, but the method feels criminal, described as “illegal denim”.
