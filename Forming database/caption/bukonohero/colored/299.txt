One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A powerful attack, depicted as a large purple energy blast, strikes a large, winged, muscular character, causing a crater in the ground.  Several other characters are shown in smaller panels; one with blond hair appears to be launching the attack, others are engaged in combat. Text indicates the central character's reliance on inner strength ("Heart is power") and his finding allies. The overall scene suggests a climactic moment of a fight, with a decisive blow being delivered.
