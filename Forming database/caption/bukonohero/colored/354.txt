A manga panel depicting a scene with several characters and text boxes revealing internal monologues.  A young boy with red hair is shown, clutching a wounded arm, seemingly in pain.  The next panel shows a scarred, older man with red hair.  A subsequent panel displays the older man kneeling, while two other figures are seen in the distance on a bridge.  The text boxes express regret, envy, frustration, and a sense of what could have been, suggesting a complex relationship between the characters.  The overall tone is melancholic and reflective.
