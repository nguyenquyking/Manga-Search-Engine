Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A female character with white hair, wearing a white and purple outfit, delivers a powerful, bloody kick to a large, muscular male opponent.  The kick connects, causing significant injury and a spray of blood.  Simultaneously, a purple energy source is shown, possibly related to the attack or the opponent's powers. The male opponent screams in pain ("ARGHHHH!"), expressing his distress.  Another panel shows a large, dark figure confined within a small space, commenting "Cramped in here."  Text in the image includes "NOT DONE YET!" indicating the fight is ongoing. The style suggests high-impact action and intense violence.
