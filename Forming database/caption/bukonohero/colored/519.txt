One Piece manga panel depicting a group of characters, including Midnight, planning to sedate someone.  The large amount of sedative needed necessitates an oral dose rather than injection due to the target's constant movement.  A single, undiluted vial is shown, suggesting its potency. The characters are discussing the plan, with concern for Midnight's well-being also expressed.  The scene takes place in a forest setting with a large number of dark purple spheres visible.
