A manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A grey-haired man in a dark suit, possibly La Brava's companion, apologizes and flees ("I am sorry, young man! But I must be off!") after a powerful blow.  A green-haired boy, possibly a student, is shown in motion, having delivered the blow, and warns against harming the school ("Then don't lay a hand on the school!").  The scene is dynamic, showing speed and impact.  The grey-haired man's surprising resilience is noted ("Namely, if he can withstand a blow of that magnitude despite his appearance"). The overall tone is one of conflict and swift resolution.
