Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A manga panel depicts a tense battle scene.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku), visibly strained and injured, is shown using One For All at 45%,  simultaneously activating Danger Sense, Smokescreen, Blackwhip, Fa Jin, and Float quirks.  He's struggling to control the overwhelming power, leading to his body freezing up.  Another character, seemingly an opponent, watches with a serious expression.  The panel showcases Midoriya's determination and the taxing nature of his abilities, highlighting the rapid succession of quirk activations.  A previous action, possibly a strike by another character, is shown in a smaller panel.
