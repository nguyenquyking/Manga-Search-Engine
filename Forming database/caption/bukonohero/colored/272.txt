Close-up of a young boy, possibly Luffy's son (though not explicitly stated), with light gray hair, crying and smiling simultaneously.  Tears stream down his face. A speech bubble above him reads, "BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOU FOR A FATHER." The overall visual style suggests a dramatic and emotional moment from a manga.  The image is heavily stylized, with a focus on the character's emotional expression.
