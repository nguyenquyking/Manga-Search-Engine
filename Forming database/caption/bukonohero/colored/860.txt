Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panels:  A flashback sequence depicts a character, possibly a younger version of the main character, remembering a kind grandpa and grandma.  The scene shifts dramatically, showing the character, with white hair, falling amidst a large explosion and destruction.  The character is shown lying injured and surrounded by debris, reflecting on something they needed to be told.  The overall tone is one of somber reflection and dramatic action.
