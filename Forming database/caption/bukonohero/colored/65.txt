A dynamic One Piece manga panel depicting a powerful attack.  A character (unidentifiable due to the artistic style and motion blur) unleashes a bright blue energy beam, labeled "KERAUÃ‘OS!!", which explodes into a large, swirling blue wave. The scene is highly stylized, focusing on the energy and motion of the attack.  The action implies a powerful, possibly destructive, attack in progress.
