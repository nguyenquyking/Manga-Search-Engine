One Piece manga panel depicting a high-speed chase.  A character with a large, dark blue, bioluminescent body, possibly a Zoan type Devil Fruit user, moves incredibly fast, described as "insane speed".  Another character, seemingly a female with white hair and dark clothing, experiences a sensory enhancement, feeling "so very clear," suggesting a connection to the fast-moving entity or the effects of a power.  A third character, in dark clothing and a crown-like headpiece, observes, questioning the time limit of a power. A fourth character, with flaming hair and dark clothing, is seen in the background seemingly affected by the main character's action.  The overall scene emphasizes speed, sensory perception, and the effects of a possibly time-limited power.
