A manga panel depicting intense combat.  A large, dark mass crumbles, suggesting a powerful attack.  A character with white hair is shown in a grappling hold, seemingly overwhelmed. Another character, possibly a villain with a prominent jawline and reddish skin, observes.  In subsequent panels, the white-haired character is thrown violently to the ground, indicated by "THUD" onomatopoeia.  A third character, with orange hair and a suit, seems to be controlling or observing the fight, his hand showing a small, dark object crumbling. The overall scene is one of high-impact action and destruction.
