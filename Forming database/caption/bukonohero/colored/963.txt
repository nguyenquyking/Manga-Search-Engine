My Hero Academia manga chapter 135 depicts three characters:  Midoriya Izuku, Bakugo Katsuki, and a third, unnamed character with green and blonde hair wearing glasses.  Midoriya and Bakugo are determined, clenching their fists, and vowing to protect Eri ("We'll protect her!", "We won't fail you this time, Eri!!").  The third character, wearing glasses, agrees with their resolve ("Yes, and that"). The scene emphasizes their commitment to rescuing Eri, highlighting the phrase "Will be our goal."  The visual style is consistent with My Hero Academia's manga artwork.
