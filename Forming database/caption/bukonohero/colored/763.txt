Close-up panel showing Hawks, severely injured, being embraced by a person with blonde hair, possibly a woman, wearing a sailor uniform. Hawks is grimacing, and speech bubbles indicate a tense exchange.  Hawks is told to "Die," but retorts that the other person doesn't get to call him unlucky. The second panel shows a discarded piece of clothing on the ground and text expressing happiness and longing to be with others. The scene is somber and suggests a significant event has occurred.
