A manga panel depicting a conversation between a woman and a man named Tenko.  The woman, with medium-length brown hair, asks Tenko, a pale-skinned man with white hair, if he still wants to be a hero.  Tenko appears smaller than the woman, possibly due to a power difference or visual effect.  The background shows a city in ruins, suggesting a battle or catastrophic event.  The woman's expression is concerned, while Tenko's is stoic.  Earlier panels show Tenko dismissively saying "Whatever" and "Oh, that."  The final panel shows the woman's red, irritated eyes, and Tenko's similarly red eyes, indicating a shared intense experience.
