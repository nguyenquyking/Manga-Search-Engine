A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting the transfer of One For All.  The panel shows a close-up of a young All Might (with his face obscured) and another character (possibly Nana Shimura)  illustrating the process of One For All's transfer.  A golden chalice containing a swirling blue liquid represents the quirk.  Text boxes explain that Yagi (All Might) maintained One For All for 40 years, imbuing it with a piece of his consciousness.  The process is described as a perfect fit for an empty vessel, but forcing it into a vessel with an existing quirk results in a shortened lifespan.  The image also shows examples of successful and failed transfers.
