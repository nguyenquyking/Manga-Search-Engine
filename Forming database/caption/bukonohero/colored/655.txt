A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene. Dabi, with his signature scarred face and dark clothing, expresses regret at failing to stop a female character (likely Toga Himiko), whose distressed state is highlighted.  Another character, possibly a villain in a mask and top hat, questions the whereabouts of others.  The scene shows a large, destructive ice attack, with several figures injured or downed amidst shards of ice and blood splatter, suggesting a fierce confrontation.  A melting, possibly injured, figure is shown in the left panel, and the words "Hard to keep living" appear near it. The overall tone is violent and grim.
