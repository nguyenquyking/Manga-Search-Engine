My analysis of the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  The image depicts a scene where a man, presumably Hexamendle, is disintegrating, his red quirk dissipating.  Tomura Shigaraki stands observing him from a distance on a fragmented platform.  Narrative text boxes explain that Hexamendle foresaw his downfall and passed on his quirk to Shigaraki.  The overall mood is somber and dramatic, emphasizing the transfer of power.
