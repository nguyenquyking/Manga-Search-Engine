A manga panel depicting a large, rapidly spreading blue fire engulfing a group of people.  Kaminari expresses concern for an injured person, possibly in his lap, stating the fire is spreading too fast and that someone didn't hold back.  Another character, seemingly in a protective suit, recounts being blown away before the fire could trap them, implying some are still trapped. The scene shows chaos and urgency.  The visual elements include intense blue flames, smoke, and distressed characters.
