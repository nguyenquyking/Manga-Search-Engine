My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a critical battle scene.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku) is shown in a close-up, his face strained with determination and worry, as a powerful energy surge emanates from him.  The background shows a chaotic fight with numerous Nomu (villainous creatures) engaging other heroes.  Katsuki Bakugo (Bakugo) is visible in the background, also engaged in combat.  A panel below shows a group of Class 1-A students reacting with concern, including Midoriya, Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, and Ochaco Uraraka.  The final panel shows a distressed Shota Aizawa (Eraserhead) being comforted by another hero, likely All Might (though not fully visible). The overall scene conveys a sense of urgency and impending loss, focusing on the students' concern for their teacher.
