A manga-style comic panel depicts a serious discussion among characters.  One character, a man with dark hair and a stern expression, is the central focus, with thought bubbles revealing internal deliberations about an unnamed "guy" who "never stops smiling."  Another panel shows a car speeding away.  The dialogue boxes discuss strategic decisions, involving expanding a search, confronting enemies, and the lack of useful intelligence from supervillains. The overall mood is tense and strategic.
