A female character with lavender hair, wearing a dark sleeveless top and futuristic boots, uses her "Air Walk" quirk to move through the rain. She states, "I've got a mission to carry out."  In a separate panel, a large, fiery hand is shown, representing a contract to deliver a "death blow to hateful heroes." A smaller panel depicts the same female character, airborne, offering something as a "deposit." The overall scene depicts a mission briefing or contract initiation with a villainous character.
