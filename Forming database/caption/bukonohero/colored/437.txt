A dynamic manga panel depicting a powerful female character, possibly a hero, reaching down towards a partially obscured male character, possibly a villain or another hero.  The female character has dark hair, a dark sleeveless top, and gold-colored gloves. She is saying, "...so let us handle this."  The male character has bright green spiky hair and is partially obscured by a motion blur effect, suggesting high speed or a powerful energy release. The overall scene is intense, showcasing a moment of action or intervention.  The art style is reminiscent of a shonen manga, with heavy inking and dramatic motion lines.  A text caption at the bottom reads "Next chapter hits Oct. 11!"
