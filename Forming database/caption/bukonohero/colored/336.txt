Here's a caption describing the provided manga image panels:  **Panel 1-2:** Izuku Midoriya (Deku) reacts to an event, feeling a familiar sensation.  A large, powerful entity is shown being bound by numerous thin, sharp wires.  The text indicates a significant event is imminent.  **Panel 3:** A large, monstrous figure, heavily bound by the wires, is shown from behind. A blond-haired man, presumably a hero, is seen in the lower right, actively tightening or manipulating the wires around the monster. The text describes the impending chaos.  **Panel 4-5:** The blond hero (possibly Endeavor or another prominent hero, visual confirmation needed) is shown, seemingly injured, as more wires wrap around the monster.  Another panel shows the same blond hero in action, reacting to the chaotic situation. The text suggests the hero's return and the severity of the situation.
