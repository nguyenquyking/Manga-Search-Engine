Manga panel depicting several scenes.  The first shows a person walking away, followed by a view of the UA building in the rain.  The next panel shows Shoto Todoroki, Denki Kaminari, and a third character (possibly a pro hero) standing in the rain, alongside a mysterious figure in a long coat.  The text indicates they are reacting to Uravity's speech.  A background panel shows other students.  The overall mood is somber and possibly post-event.
