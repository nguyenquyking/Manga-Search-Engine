One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A figure in a white and red costume (likely a hero) kneels over a seemingly lifeless, white-haired individual lying in a pool of water, indicating a recent submersion.  Text indicates the white-haired individual's heart stopped.  Another panel shows a doctor-like figure attending to the white-haired person with a capsule.  The doctor explains the individual is in a death-like state to withstand a procedure.  A final panel shows a distraught, older man with a mustache weeping, stating he's only been living for Shigaraki.  The overall scene suggests a critical moment during a medical procedure or battle, possibly involving Shigaraki's life or well-being.
