One Piece manga panel depicting emotional distress.  A young woman with red hair, overwhelmed with sadness, declares "I hate... everyone!"  She is shown crying, with text stating this built up "little by little, over time."  In a flashback, her parents are shown, the mother comforting her.  The father is smiling but the narrative implies he always made excuses for his actions.  The scene emphasizes the emotional burden and resentment caused by the father's actions, highlighting his absence and the family's coping mechanisms.  The young woman's emotional breakdown is contrasted with the parents' seemingly unconcerned expressions.
