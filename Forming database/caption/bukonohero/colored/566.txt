A manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  The top panel shows two figures engaged in combat: one with fiery orange energy emanating from them, the other with white, possibly ice-based, energy.  The fiery figure states, "I wanna be..." while the other declares, "...greater than you."  The bottom panel shifts focus to a close-up of a character with pale skin, white hair, a bloody eye, and a sinister grin, who says, "I control myself."  A smaller panel next to him shows another, seemingly weaker, character with white hair covering their face, seemingly distressed, to whom the first character shouts, "Shut the hell up."  The overall tone is intense and violent.
