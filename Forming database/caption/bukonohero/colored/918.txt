A manga panel depicting several characters against a backdrop of a modern cityscape.  The characters are presented in individual panels, suggesting a sequence of viewpoints or perspectives.  From top to bottom:  An older man with gray hair and dark glasses, a hooded figure with a white cloak and purple mask (possibly Hawks), a character with dark hair and goggles showing signs of injury, a character with green hair and gold-rimmed glasses, a character with light green hair and bat-like features partially obscuring their face, and finally, a large, round, tan-colored figure with a menacing expression.  The city features a tall, cylindrical building and other modern structures.  The overall scene suggests a confrontation or tense situation in an urban setting.
