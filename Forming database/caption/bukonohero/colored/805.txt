A manga panel depicting Hawks, visibly distressed, lamenting his lateness ("I'm too late!!").  He reflects on the events in Deika, acknowledging the casualties ("All those good little citizens wouldn't have had to die...").  Another character, possibly a villain, is shown shouting ("RAAAH") in the background.  Hawks's regret is emphasized, contrasting with the villain's triumph.  The scene suggests a significant loss of life and a failed attempt to prevent it.
