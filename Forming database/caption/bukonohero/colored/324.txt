My Hero Academia comic panel depicting a group of students, including Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, Ochaco Uraraka, Tsuyu Asui, and Momo Yaoyorozu, watching a small lizard-like creature surrounded by yellow energy.  A blond-haired character, possibly All Might, observes them, commenting on their battle plan and the progress of one of the students' quirk training. The scene takes place in what appears to be a student common area or dorm.  The discussion centers around a multipronged battle plan scheduled for tomorrow.
