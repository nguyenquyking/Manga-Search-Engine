A menacing villain with white hair and red eyes, dominates the frame, his enormous hand reaching towards the viewer.  He demands "Hand over One For All, Izuku Midoriya," adding "...of Death."  A smaller panel shows Izuku Midoriya (presumably) using One For All, depicted by a white energy blast labeled "SHWAP," suggesting a prior attack. The overall scene is dramatic and intense, emphasizing the villain's power and threat.  The background features fiery, volcanic imagery.
