This One Piece manga panel depicts a scene of intense public anger directed at a character, possibly a hero, in the aftermath of a catastrophic event.  An angry mob shouts insults like "Coward!", "You fakes!", "You got no right to show your face around here!", and "Just seeing your face makes us feel hopeless all over again!".  A sign reads, "My family faced the flames," referencing a tragedy caused by Dabi.  In a subsequent panel, Endeavor (the hero) stands with another character, possibly his son, Shoto Todoroki, looking dejected in the rain, facing away from the mob.  The background shows a rain-soaked cityscape, reflecting the devastation.  The overall mood is one of despair, grief, and public outrage.
