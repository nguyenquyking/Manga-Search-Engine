A supermassive villain is moving north from Mt. Gunga in Wakayama Prefecture towards Jaku City in the greater Kyoto region.  The predicted path includes Mino, Kakun, Nebaro, Hando, Mosu, Horisu, Kuraudo, Karida, Karamari, Suinara, Hau, and Sairo cities.  Three heroes, including a female hero (possibly Ochaco Uraraka) in a white and pink hero suit, are shown.  A panel depicts a defeated or injured villain on the ground in a ravaged landscape. The heroes seem concerned about the situation and the fact that most heroes are away on missions.
