A manga panel depicting a tense scene.  A white-haired man in a dark shirt stands before a large red throne in a damaged room.

The scene takes place inside the One for All realm before Midoriya's awakening. The white-haired man needs their help to unleash his full power.  Visual elements include a damaged wall, a doorway, and an ornate throne.
