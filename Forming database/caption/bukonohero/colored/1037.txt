My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion about the Kingpin's demise.  A character resembling Twice (with a mask) reflects on the Kingpin, formerly feared by older generations but treated as an urban legend by his own.  Another character, possibly Hawks, comments that the Kingpin's fall is a more significant event than All Might's.  The final panel shows the Kingpin imprisoned in Tartarus.
