A manga panel depicting a scene of devastation.  A bloodied hand lies on the ground in one panel. Another shows a child crying amidst rubble.  A man and woman are seen tending to an injured person in the debris. A larger panel shows a muscular, bloodied man, possibly Endeavor, with bright eyes.  The narrative text boxes reveal a backstory of Endeavor's ambition and the creation of a character (possibly his son) driven by his father's selfish goals. The overall scene depicts a powerful emotional moment in a post-battle scenario, highlighting themes of ambition, failure, and familial relationships.
