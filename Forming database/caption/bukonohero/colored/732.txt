A young boy, Keigo Takami, is told he must say goodbye to his name to become a special hero.  He's shown being addressed by two figures in suits, and the scene transitions to show him  in profile, then head-on, looking serious, while clutching a small golden bird-like figure. The text indicates a challenging training program awaits.  In a separate panel, a larger, possibly older, Takami is seen, along with other figures in black, suggesting a possible flashback or foreshadowing. The overall tone is serious and foreboding, hinting at the start of a significant journey.
