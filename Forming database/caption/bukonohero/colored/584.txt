My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  All Might, in his hero costume, observes a powerful fiery energy blast emanating from a muscular, seemingly villainous character.  Another character, with light skin and dark hair, is shown reacting to the blast in a separate panel.  Text boxes explain that the power is not a quirk but the villain's strength, and that excessive body modification has overloaded the villain's brain.  A subsequent panel shows All Might comparing the villain's power to his own, noting it is not as strong. Another panel shows a close-up of the villain's face and a description of their fighting style, emphasizing their mid-air maneuverability.
