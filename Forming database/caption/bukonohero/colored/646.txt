A high-angle, long shot depicts a desolate, cloud-shrouded landscape in the One Piece manga.  A large, weathered, tree-like structure, possibly a ruined building or ancient relic, stands prominently.  Several figures, too small to identify individually, are perched atop the structure. The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and mystery.  The sky is partly cloudy, and a hazy atmosphere dominates the scene. No specific character names can be identified from the image's detail.
