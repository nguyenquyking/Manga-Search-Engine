Here's a concise caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A dynamic battle scene unfolds between a dark-skinned female hero, possibly Himiko Toga (though this is not explicitly confirmed by the image), with long white hair, unleashing powerful, swirling energy blasts, and a shadowy, dark-skinned villain.  The hero's attacks are depicted with speed lines and onomatopoeia (BWOOOSH). The villain is visibly injured, with blood splatters and expressions of pain. The hero is shown both attacking and reacting to the villain's attempts to counter. The text suggests the villain is struggling to counterattack effectively.
