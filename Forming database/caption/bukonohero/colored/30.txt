A colored manga panel depicts a scene with multiple characters.  In the upper panel, a blond-haired man in a suit addresses a group of heroes.  He states, "...Then I would ask you to fortify yourselves using this extension we've been given." and "...but if you hope to protect anything you hold dear at all...".  The heroes include Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, and others.  The blond-haired man appears to be leading or instructing them. The lower panels show a close-up of Katsuki Bakugo's face, with exaggerated expressions and sound effects, declaring "Already way ahead of ya!!"  The style suggests dynamic action and tension.
