Panel 1: A wide shot showing a large ice structure collapsing.  Numerous figures, likely heroes, are scattered amidst the falling ice. Text indicates a "zoom" effect and a command to send medics.  Panel 2:  A close-up of Mt. Lady (blonde hair, purple and white hero costume) angrily confronting a figure amidst the ice shards.  The text is her expressing anger at being hurt, and asking if they were cubed or crushed.  Other heroes are visible in the background, still battling amidst the ice.  Panel 3:  Mt. Lady is shown again, promising to bring down the ice mountain quickly. Cementoss (a hero with a grey and green costume) is seen in the background.  Panel 4:  Two heroes are shown â€“ one with a blue and grey costume (likely Mr. Compress), the other with a partially visible yellow and brown outfit.  The text suggests they are pursuing Mt. Lady's targets.  Other heroes are in the background, also pursuing enemies.  The text instructs them to follow Mt. Lady and continue the roundup.
