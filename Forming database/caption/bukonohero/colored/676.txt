The manga panel depicts several scenes.  The first shows a blond-haired character comforting a distressed, bird-like character (Hawks), reassuring him that his actions were right and encouraging him not to die. The second panel shows a muscular, bald man (likely Destro) seated, demanding to know what's happening with his spare legs. The final panel shows Destro, enraged, reacting to something and a large crowd of people. The overall scene suggests a post-battle situation with emotional and physical aftermath.
