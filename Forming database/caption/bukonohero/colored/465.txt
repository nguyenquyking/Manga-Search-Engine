Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga panel suitable for vector embedding:  A bloody battle scene. A character with grey hair is impaled and flung backward by a large, icy blue projectile labeled "Hexamendie."  Another character in dark clothing and green accents is partially visible, seemingly the source of the attack.  The background shows motion lines and blood splatter.  Japanese onomatopoeia, "Yank" and "Shink," depict the sound of the attack. A third character, partially visible and wearing a helmet, is near the base of the projectile.  The overall image suggests a violent, high-stakes confrontation.
