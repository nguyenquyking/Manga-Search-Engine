A colored manga panel depicts a strategic meeting.  Several characters are present, including a dark-skinned man with yellow goggles (possibly a leader), a woman with green hair and sharp claws (possibly a villain), and Nighteye (a man with glasses, possibly a strategist).  The discussion centers on a female target's location and a plan to neutralize her and affiliated groups.  The strategy involves isolating key points of contact and minimizing the risk of a counterattack.  A map or data display shows the location of various groups and organizations. The overall tone is serious and focused on tactical planning.
