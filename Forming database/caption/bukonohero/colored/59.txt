One Piece manga panel depicting a powerful female character, possibly a captain, addressing her crew.  She is blonde with muscular build, wearing a striped shirt and is confidently declaring her leadership ("Starting today, you boys are under my wing!"). Her crew, seemingly pilots in aircraft, are shown in smaller panels, one expressing concern ("Aw, hell!") and another reacting to her command, preparing for action ("Copy that!").  The scene shows dynamic action with an aircraft maneuvering ("Shake that ragged lowlife off your topside!"), and emphasizes the camaraderie and loyalty within the group ("When we die, we die together, brothers!"). The overall tone is one of action, determination, and strong leadership.
