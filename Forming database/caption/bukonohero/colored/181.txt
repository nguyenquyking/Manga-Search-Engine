Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panels:  A blond-haired character, possibly a cyborg, is shown monitoring a GPS signal that has suddenly disappeared.  He reacts with concern and frustration ("What now?!," "Dammit!").  The signal loss is visually represented by a blank area on a screen displaying a city map. A vehicle is seen speeding away amidst rain. In another panel, a teal-colored character appears to be unleashing a powerful energy blast, resulting in a large explosion ("BOOM") in a city setting. The panels show a dynamic action sequence involving rapid vehicle movement, technology failure, and a powerful attack.
