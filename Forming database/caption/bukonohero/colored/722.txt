Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga comic panels:  A bloody and injured female character, possibly a pirate, exclaims "Crap!" as she's violently yanked upwards by a powerful force.  A bald, mustachioed man in goggles, possibly a scientist or doctor, observes the scene with a smirk, sound effects indicating explosions ("Boom") and alarms ("Beep"). The scene depicts intense action and a power struggle, with the woman's body being forcefully pulled away.  Visual elements emphasize the force and damage inflicted.
