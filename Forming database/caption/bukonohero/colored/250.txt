A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a conversation between three pro heroes.  Hawks, with his signature blond hair and masked face, gives a thumbs-up, suggesting a collaborative effort.  Endeavor, partially visible, is shown in a separate panel, seemingly recovering.  The dialogue focuses on shared responsibility and the proposal of a team-up between the top three heroes to lighten the burden on Endeavor's family.  Hawksâ€™ commitment to supporting Endeavor is emphasized.
