A manga panel depicting Toga Himiko in a dilapidated, graffiti-covered room.  The top panel shows Toga from behind, facing a wall with "YOU'LL PAY" scrawled on it. The room is dark and littered with debris.  The middle panel shows a close-up of Toga's face, her expression serious and intense. The bottom panels show her again, in a different part of the room, and a close-up of a wall with more graffiti.  Text in a speech bubble reads "Just stop it already!!"  The overall mood is tense and dark.
