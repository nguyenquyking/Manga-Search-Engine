A manga panel depicting a powerful energy blast.  A character, possibly a villain, with dark hair and a gas mask is shown in the top left panel, appearing surprised. In the central panels, a large, monstrous, rocky creature with multiple arms is shown collapsing amidst a massive, bright explosion.  A smaller figure, potentially a hero, is shown falling from the creature's grasp.  The scene is chaotic and filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia ("FOOM," "KRACK," "!!") indicating the intensity of the energy blast. The bottom panel shows a swirling vortex of purple energy.
