Here's a concise description of the provided One Piece manga image suitable for vector embedding:  A heavily stylized manga panel depicts a battle scene.  A dark-haired character, possibly Izuku Midoriya (based on visual similarities), lies injured, seemingly supported by a large, sand-colored figure, possibly a manifestation of One For All's fourth user.  Dust and energy effects surround them.  A speech bubble above the injured character states "No wonder my gift from the fourth... wouldn't shut up."  The bottom panel shows a close-up of a sinister-looking face, possibly an antagonist, with a speech bubble reading, "Hey, I know that voice..."  The text "Next chapter hits Apr. 4!" is included.
