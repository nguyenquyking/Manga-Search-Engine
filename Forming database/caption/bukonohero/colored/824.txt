A manga panel depicting a large-scale battle with significant destruction.  A muscular, red-haired character (possibly a villain) unleashes a powerful attack, causing widespread devastation to a city.  Another, smaller character with dark hair is shown using a green energy attack in defense.  The scene is filled with motion lines indicating powerful force and destruction.  The background shows a city in ruins, and there are various other smaller characters visible in the chaos, suggesting a large-scale conflict. The onomatopoeia "FUOOOOM" emphasizes the destructive force. The visual style strongly suggests a shonen manga battle scene.
