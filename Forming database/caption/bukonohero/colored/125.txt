Rain lashes down on a city square as a colossal, icy shard crashes down.  A large group of characters, seemingly heroes or fighters, stands amidst the chaos, facing the impact.  Among them, recognizable characters from One Piece are visible, though precise identification requires higher resolution.  In the foreground, several bystanders, civilians, crouch and observe the aftermath, their faces reflecting concern.  A figure with bright green hair is on the ground near a glowing green symbol, possibly injured or using a power. The overall scene is one of intense action and dramatic impact.
