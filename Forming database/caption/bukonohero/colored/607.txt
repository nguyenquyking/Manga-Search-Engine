Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A color manga panel depicts a dramatic confrontation.  A fiery-haired character, possibly Endeavor (implied by the visual style), unleashes a powerful blast, labeled "radio waves," causing widespread destruction in a city below.  Another character, possibly All For One (judging by the hand and style), falls from above.  All For One's hand is shown launching an "air blast" while another hand appears to be deflecting the initial attack. Text bubbles indicate the characters' actions and thoughts;  All For One apologizes to "Number One," while Endeavor's attack is described. The overall scene is chaotic, showcasing the destructive power of the characters' abilities.
