A manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  Yoichi, a character with white hair, is shown in the first panel, recounting past events.  Another character, whose name isn't explicitly stated but appears to be the brother of Yoichi (implied by the dialogue), is shown with red eyes, reflecting on a battle where victory meant life, and defeat meant death. He explains that he sought to bring down Yoichi's brother, costing many lives.  The final panel shows Yoichi, another character with bright green hair, and a third character with dark hair, questioning the decision to save their "mortal enemy". The overall mood is serious and dramatic, highlighting the conflict and moral dilemma.
