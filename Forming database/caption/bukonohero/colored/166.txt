Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A four-panel manga spread depicts a dynamic fight scene. Panel one shows a teal-skinned, masked character with yellow clothing, possibly Izuku Midoriya (Deku) from My Hero Academia, launching an attack, electric energy crackling around them. Panel two shows a purple-haired woman deflecting an attack with a glowing blade,  text indicating she blocked two shots. Panel three shows a man running in the rain, while panel four shows the same purple-haired woman with another person, likely an ally or subordinate, observing a fallen man in the rain. The overall scene suggests a confrontation, with the focus on both the masked hero's attack and the purple haired woman's defense within a rain-soaked urban environment.
