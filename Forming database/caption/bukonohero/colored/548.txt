This One Piece manga panel depicts a battle scene.  A large, earth-like golem is shown attacking a forest, indicated by "KRAK" sound effects and its destructive path.  A female hero, possibly Hexamendle, is shown initially launching a powerful attack ("POP") against a piece of the golem, but is subsequently overwhelmed and lying injured on the ground, expressing concern about the golem's size. Another character, a masked villain, observes the scene, commenting on underestimating heroes. The scene emphasizes the sheer scale and power of the golem, contrasting with the hero's apparent inability to effectively counter it.
