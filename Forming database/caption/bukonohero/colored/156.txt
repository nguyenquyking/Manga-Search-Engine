A massive explosion engulfs a cityscape.  The word "BOOM" is visible above the blast.  In the aftermath, a figure, presumably Nagant, is shown in a panel below, shouting "NAGANT!!" with electricity crackling around her. Another panel depicts a charred and falling figure, likely a victim of the explosion. The overall scene depicts a powerful attack by Nagant resulting in significant destruction and casualties.
