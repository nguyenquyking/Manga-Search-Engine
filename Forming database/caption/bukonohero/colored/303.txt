My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Top panel shows a blonde-haired character (likely Dabi's accomplice) using a dark, string-like power against a female character with short, light blue hair, who is injured and screaming.  The text indicates Dabi is involved.  The second panel shows the same injured blue-haired female.  The third panel features a determined blonde-haired male character (likely a pro-hero) with gritted teeth, and a text bubble urging to stop the escape of the villains.  The fourth panel shows a bloody and injured Katsuki Bakugo on the ground.  The fifth panel shows a smiling Shoto Todoroki, also injured but seemingly victorious. The bottom panel shows a severely injured and bleeding character, possibly a pro-hero, looking upwards.  The overall scene is dynamic, violent, and suggests a desperate fight.
