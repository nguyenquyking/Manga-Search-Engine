One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  A pale-haired character with dark markings around their eyes, partially obscured by their hands, is shown in multiple panels speaking. They are expressing resentment and demanding their body back.  Another character, large and winged, is seen in the background amidst a cityscape, seemingly a consequence of the pale-haired character's actions.  The dialogue reveals a conflict arising from the powerful will and hatred of the pale-haired character, who was previously given strength by the other. The scene is dark and stormy, with rain falling.  The visual style is reminiscent of One Piece's more dramatic and intense fight sequences.
