Here's a detailed caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A large fiery explosion, labeled "BURST," dominates the scene, engulfing a cityscape in destruction.  Shigaraki Tomura is shown in a panel above, unable to use his quirks.  Below, a character (likely a pro hero) with red, teary eyes, thanks a smaller, helmeted character, possibly named Manual, for assistance.  Manual explains that excessive use of their power would flood his eyes. The smaller character is helping the larger character to maintain synchronization, likely referring to a power or ability.  The background shows widespread urban devastation from the large explosion.  The scene depicts a moment of intense action and collaboration amidst significant destruction.
