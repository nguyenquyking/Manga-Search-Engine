A manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A powerful, stern-faced character with red eyes declares, "Taking him down is why I'm still alive," and warns, "Don't you dare lay a rotten finger on my students."  Another character, seemingly defeated, is shown falling from the sky. A third character, with white hair and red eyes, comments, "...Pretty cool, Eraser Head," implying a sarcastic admiration.  The overall tone is intense and action-oriented.
