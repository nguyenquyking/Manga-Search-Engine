Panel from My Hero Academia Chapter 285:  A dynamic action scene depicts a powerful explosion emanating from a fiery blast.  One character, seemingly Izuku Midoriya (Deku), is shown mid-air, his leg extended in a powerful kick, generating the explosion.  The other panel shows a close-up of Deku's face, marked with blood and strain, with the internal monologue "...in my head. My body..." suggesting a loss of control or intense physical exertion.  The visual style emphasizes speed and impact through motion lines and the intense energy of the explosion.  The chapter number, 285, is displayed prominently.
