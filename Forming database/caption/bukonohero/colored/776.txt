Manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A severely injured, blond-haired man (likely a villain) speaks, expressing resentment towards those he considers "heroes" for their perceived cruelty in driving downtrodden people to desperation.  He notes that in such conflicts, someone must die. Another character, implied to be Toga (from the dialogue), is mentioned. The injured man reflects on Toga's past kindness and his own manipulative actions, implying he has orchestrated events for his own benefit.  Blood is visible on the injured man. The overall tone is dark and dramatic.
