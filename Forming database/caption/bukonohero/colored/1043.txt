A manga panel depicts a violent scene.  A character's body is disintegrating into pieces, with blood splatter prominently displayed.  The word "SPLASH!" is written in large, red letters.  A kneeling figure, possibly  Purple-haired  (likely Shigaraki Tomura), observes the aftermath.  In the upper panel, a shadowy figure with sunglasses, possibly a villain, looks down, their expression tense. The bottom panel shows close-ups of other characters, possibly including Toga Himiko and other League of Villains members, reacting to the event.  The scene strongly suggests a brutal attack and showcases the power and violence of the attacker.
