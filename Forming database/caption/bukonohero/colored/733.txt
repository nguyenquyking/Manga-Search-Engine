This image depicts a young Hawks (from My Hero Academia) in three panels.  Panel one shows him holding a golden object, resembling part of his wings, and pondering, "Can I be a hero who beats the bad guys?" Panel two shows him holding the same object and thinking, "Can I be a shining light for everyone?"  Panel three shows a close-up of an older, more mature Hawks, seemingly in a battle, with a powerful expression, and the words, "Who are you?!"  The overall theme is Hawks's aspiration to be a hero and a potential reflection on his past.
