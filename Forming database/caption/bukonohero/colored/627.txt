A manga panel depicting a tense interaction between two characters.  One, with fiery blonde hair and a determined expression, asks "One...for...all?".  The other, whose face is partially obscured by flowing white hair, states, "To get One For All."  The background shows a devastated landscape with sparkling effects suggesting energy release. The overall scene is dramatic and suggestive of a power transfer or conflict.
