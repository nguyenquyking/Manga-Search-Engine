Here's a detailed caption for the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  A chaotic battle scene unfolds, showcasing multiple characters engaged in intense combat.  A large, muscular villain with a bird-like mask and powerful gauntlets (likely Overhaul) is central, surrounded by intense destruction and the dismembered bodies of his victims.  Other characters, including a dark-haired hero in green and a hooded figure in white, are actively fighting Overhaul. Another hero with light blue hair is shown reacting to the scene's intensity.  In other panels, additional heroes are depicted in motion, suggesting pursuit or escape. The scene emphasizes speed, violence, and the aftermath of a powerful Quirk-based attack.  Text bubbles reveal dialogue indicating surprise, regret at a missed opportunity, and the realization of the villain's powerful Quirk.  The overall tone is one of high stakes and imminent danger.
