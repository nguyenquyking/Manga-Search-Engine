A prison monitoring system is under attack.  A large metal panel is overloaded with pink electrical energy, indicating an EMP attack.  A character, possibly a guard, with purple hair and a military-style uniform reacts in alarm, reporting the system failure. The text indicates the attack's unexpected nature and scale, overwhelming the prison's defenses.
