Her older sister initially chastises her for causing trouble, but then comforts her, holding her hand. The final panel shows a close-up of their clasped hands, leading to a swirling, fragmented memory flashback indicating emotional distress.  The narrative focuses on Hana's innocent words and the comforting presence of her older sister.
