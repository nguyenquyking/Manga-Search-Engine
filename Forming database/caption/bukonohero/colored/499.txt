A manga panel depicting a large, shadowy figure and several smaller characters.  A female character, possibly a villain, with pale skin, horns, and distinctive yellow eyes, is shown in a close-up exhibiting a fearful expression, saying "Ah!".  She is partially submerged in a blue, watery substance.  Another panel shows the large figure, seemingly a giant or monstrous being, reaching toward a building, with the text "All for my master..." This is followed by a panel showing a close-up of the figure's eye, with the text "That voice...". In the final panel, three smaller, frightened female characters are huddled together, one of them crying and saying "Wahh!", while another states, "Too scary!".  The overall setting appears to be an urban environment, with buildings visible in the background. The style is reminiscent of My Hero Academia.
