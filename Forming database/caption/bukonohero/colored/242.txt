Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A manga panel shows a conversation between two characters. One character, with short, spiky, bright green hair, appears distressed, possibly indicating a power limitation.  Another character, with long, white hair, listens intently.  The dialogue reveals that the green-haired character's unique ability (possibly quirk) can no longer be transferred, and people possessing such abilities are exceptionally rare in the current generation.  A smaller inset panel shows a past scene, possibly hinting at the origin or previous wielder of the unique ability. The overall mood is serious and contemplative, suggesting a significant plot point related to power and legacy.
