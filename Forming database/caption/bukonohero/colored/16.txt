Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga image:  A bloody scene depicts a character experiencing visceral pain and pleasure, possibly from a parasitic entity.  Text bubbles express feelings of happiness and a "pleasant dream."  In a separate panel, Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia) stands in a dilapidated room marked "Vampire Demon," having discarded something.  The contrast suggests a thematic connection between the two scenes, possibly relating to Toga's blood-related quirk and a dark, visceral transformation.
