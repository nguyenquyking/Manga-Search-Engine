A manga panel depicting a powerful explosion.  A character with spiky white hair is shown in the upper panel, seemingly reacting with a mix of amusement and alarm ("Yikes!", "FWP").  In the main panel, a figure (likely the same character, though obscured by the effects of a massive explosion) is launched backwards through an intense yellow and orange energy blast, labeled with "WHOOSH" and other onomatopoeia. The background shows a city under attack, with destruction evident. Text bubbles indicate a character has killed many people ("You've killed... Too many already").  The overall scene is one of high-impact action and destruction.
