One Piece manga panel depicting a flashback.  A man walks through a hallway, then outside a destroyed area.  Another panel shows a shadowy figure, possibly a monster or zombified person, crying with dark liquid dripping from their hand. The text states, "Yes, on that night..."  The overall tone is dark and ominous.  "Doom!" is written in the first panel. No specific character names are visible.  The scene suggests a catastrophic event.
