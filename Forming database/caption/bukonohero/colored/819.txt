One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A masked figure (possibly a villain) commands "Stop, Trumpet. Any more..."  Trumpet, a muscular, red-haired man, weeps and appears to be in distress, stating that continuing would bring about meaningless death. Another panel shows Trumpet raising a finger, seemingly in protest or explanation. The final panel shows a discussion between a man in a suit and sunglasses (possibly another villain) and another individual. The suited man claims the fallen fighters were following *his* will, not Destro's.  The scene is dark and gritty, suggesting a battle aftermath.
