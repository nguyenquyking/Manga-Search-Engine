Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  Shoto Todoroki, in a dynamic action pose, bursts through a scene of icy destruction, shouting "Sensei!!"  A panel shows a bloodied, injured individual in the background, with text stating, "Back there..." and "...He was the one following them!"  The overall scene is highly kinetic and suggestive of a battle or pursuit.  The background features a devastated cityscape.
