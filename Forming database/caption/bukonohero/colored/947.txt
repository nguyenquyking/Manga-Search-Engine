My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a group of characters, including a central figure with long dark hair (likely the protagonist, though not explicitly named), interacting with other students and a larger, rounder character resembling a villain.  The scene shows a conversation about a serious situation ("something terrible") requiring a group discussion.  Multiple heroes of varying ranks are mentioned to be involved.  The smaller characters appear concerned and curious, particularly about "Eightfold."  The overall mood is tense and suggests an impending event.
