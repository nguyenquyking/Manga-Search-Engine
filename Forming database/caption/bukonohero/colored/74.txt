My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All Might, visibly aged and weary,  addressing what appears to be a group of pro-heroes.  All Might states that he will deliver information only to someone who has earned his trust, referencing his belief that everything began with them.  Another character, possibly a superior or colleague, expresses relief that things have been resolved with Midoriya (Deku), while acknowledging the awkwardness of needing a killer's assistance.  Newspapers in the background announce All Might's shocking retirement and Endeavor's rise to Number One.  The overall mood is serious and reflective, focusing on the weight of All Might's legacy and the challenges faced by the pro-hero community.
