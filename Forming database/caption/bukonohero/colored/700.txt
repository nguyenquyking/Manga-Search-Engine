A chaotic battle scene unfolds, featuring several My Hero Academia characters.  Mirko, injured but alive, is shown reacting to the news that Shigaraki is inside a capsule.  Other characters are engaged in combat near a large, partially destroyed capsule.  A powerful energy beam is visible, and several villainous figures are present.  One panel shows a character, possibly a villain, whose body is disintegrating or regenerating.  The overall scene is one of intense action and urgency, with the focus on preventing Shigaraki's activation.
