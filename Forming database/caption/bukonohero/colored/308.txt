A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Multiple characters are shown injured and exhausted.  One character, blonde with a dark suit and bloodied face, is prominently featured and declares "THAT, I DO BELIEVE!".  Other panels show injured characters lying on the ground, notably a blonde woman with horns and dark clothing, and another character with spiky orange hair. The text suggests a collaborative effort, where even the smallest contributions ("thinnest threads") can create a significant impact ("mighty rope"). The overall scene conveys a sense of struggle and hard-fought victory.
