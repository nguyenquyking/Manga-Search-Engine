One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character with spiky red hair and a powerful, enraged expression is the central focus, blood spurting from wounds inflicted on his body. He declares, "And no one behind me...", suggesting a defensive stance and determination. In a separate panel, a light-haired character with a concerned expression says, "...is gonna bleed!", observing the bloody scene.  A third panel shows a large, monstrous figure (possibly a giant or transformed person) labeled "Gnat," with another smaller, red-haired figure on his back.  The overall scene is violent, with splashes of blood and energy effects adding to the intensity. The onomatopoeia "SHNK" and "SHWP" depict the sound of impact and movement.
