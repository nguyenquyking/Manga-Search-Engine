A close-up of Uraraka Ochaco, visibly distressed and drenched in rain, dominates the lower half of the image.  Speech bubbles reveal her internal conflict:  she questions who will protect the civilians.  The upper half shows a crowd of civilians huddled together under umbrellas, suggesting a scene of crisis or danger. Text indicates that Bakugou Katsuki also played a role in the situation, and that the others refuse to abandon the people in need.  The overall tone is one of intense concern and determination in the face of adversity.
