A shirtless character with white hair stands facing a disintegrating red figure labeled "Tomura."  Debris surrounds them, suggesting a powerful attack.  In subsequent panels, a close-up shows a distorted, red-faced figure, and a white-haired character, possibly a subordinate, exclaims "Master!" while another character observes, "You're looking like Kurogiri."
