A manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  A red-haired character, possibly Bakugo, is enraged, holding another character, possibly Kaminari, who is crying and pleading.  Bakugo states "No can do. You shot my senpai," while Kaminari cries out, "Please, let me go...!" and "I'm jus' a sorry soul that wanted a little power!!"  Earlier panels show Kaminari's distress and Bakugo's anger, with dialogue indicating the effects of a drug.  The overall tone is one of intense emotion and conflict.
