My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large-scale battle.  Shoto Todoroki unleashes a powerful, swirling wave of ice and fire, causing a massive ground impact.  In smaller panels, other characters are shown reacting to the attack:  Katsuki Bakugo is seen injured, and a character resembling Tamaki Amajiki is also present.  A character with lavender hair and green/yellow energy-based abilities is launching an attack.  A large, armored figure is also shown, possibly a villain or robot. The overall scene suggests a climactic moment of intense fighting with multiple characters involved in a coordinated attack.
