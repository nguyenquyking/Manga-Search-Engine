A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where several characters are gathered.  A large, tan-suited man addresses two students, one with spiky black hair and the other with spiky red hair. The black-haired student looks annoyed, while the red-haired student appears surprised.  The large man states that they are important witnesses. In a separate panel, a smaller scene shows the black-haired student and the red-haired student reacting to the situation, with the red-haired student questioning if they are the only two. Other minor characters, including a green-haired student and a dark-skinned man in a red and gold suit are present in smaller panels, providing context to the main scene. The overall mood is tense and somewhat comedic.
