A manga panel depicting a high-action scene.  Toya, with a determined expression, unleashes a powerful blue energy blast, labeled "BOOM,"  while smiling.  Another character, presumably a villain, is shown falling from a building, with the word "PWOP" indicating a sound effect. Text suggests the actions are a deliberate provocation rather than simple kindness.  The narrative dialogue reveals a plan to use the situation to their advantage, anticipating that society is currently unable to stop them.  The overall tone is one of calculated aggression and defiance.
