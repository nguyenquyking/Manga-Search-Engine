My Hero Academia Chapter 266, "Happy Life," depicts a battle scene.  A severely injured hero lies on the ground, bleeding.  Hawks, with his fiery wings partially deployed, kneels beside the injured hero, seemingly assessing the situation.  Tomura Shigaraki, with his signature decaying hands and mask, stands amidst a blue energy surge, looking indifferent.  Hawks explains his actions, stating that heroes must always be ready to save a life, while Shigaraki dismisses the concern.  The scene highlights the contrast between Hawks' concern and Shigaraki's callousness, with the injured hero representing the stakes of their conflict.
