A dark, action-packed scene unfolds. Multiple figures lie dead or dying amidst rubble, clutching firearms.  One surviving figure, a man with dark hair and red eyes, holds a baby. He states, "I require information." Another panel shows a close-up of the man holding the baby, with text indicating the others died gripping firearms.  The man considers the baby and a weapon, questioning why he chose the baby. The overall tone is grim and intense.
