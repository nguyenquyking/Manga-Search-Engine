One Piece manga scene:  Zoro, wielding two glowing green blades, stands over a defeated enemy.  The enemy, a heavily tattooed individual in a giraffe-patterned shirt, lies on the ground, seemingly incapacitated.  A third figure, possibly a bystander, is visible in the background.  Text bubbles indicate "IT'S ALREADY..." and "...OVER," signifying the conclusion of a battle.  The setting appears to be a rainy city street.
