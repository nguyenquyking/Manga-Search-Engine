Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  Ryukyu, a character with long white hair and a horn, expresses gratitude for a warning.  She's shown calmly playing with string, contrasting with a menacing, shadowy figure with glowing red eyes who declares he can handle the situation "rationally and without hesitation."  Another panel depicts Ryukyu receiving something from a partially visible, dark-haired character. The overall scene suggests a contrast between calm preparation and impending danger.
