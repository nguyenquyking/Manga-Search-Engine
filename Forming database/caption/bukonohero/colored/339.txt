One Piece manga panel depicting a large, earth-toned creature bound by numerous metallic threads controlled by multiple characters.  A blond-haired character, Jeanist, dominates the foreground, his hands manipulating the threads.  He is labeled as the "Best Jeanist," showcasing his "Fiber Master" quirk.  In the background, other characters assist, while Bakugou Katsuki (with a bloodied mouth) and another character are shown in smaller panels, seemingly reacting to the ongoing battle.  The text emphasizes the "thread of hope" created by the coordinated effort to subdue the creature.  The scene implies a high-stakes conflict with significant narrative importance.
