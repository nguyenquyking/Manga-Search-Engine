A manga panel depicting a chaotic scene in a desolate, sandy landscape. Multiple monstrous, brain-headed creatures, varying in size and form, are swarming.  These creatures appear dark gray/black with exposed brains and skeletal features. The largest creature in the foreground is central, and smaller ones surround it, suggesting an attack or swarm.  Two human figures, seemingly fleeing, are visible in the smaller panel above. One is dark-haired, and the other wears a green and black suit, indicating possible heroes or victims of the creatures. The word "DOOM" is prominently displayed twice in stylized purple text near the creatures. The overall tone is one of intense action and impending danger.
