A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blonde woman with horns, possibly a hero, uses ice powers to create a massive ice wave, crushing several figures below.  A man in a dark coat, seemingly a villain, is standing amidst the ice shards, seemingly unaffected.  Text indicates the woman's actions are to prevent further interference from "Re-Destro." Another character in a yellow jacket is shown fleeing or observing the scene. The overall visual style suggests a powerful clash between opposing forces.
