A manga panel depicting a work-study contract signing.  A stern-looking man in a white suit and glasses, possibly a superior or mentor, sits at a desk. A younger, enthusiastic individual, possibly a student, approaches him with paperwork. The older man explains the contract completion process, emphasizing the importance of his personal seal. The younger character eagerly agrees and hands over the necessary form from school.  The scene also includes a brief earlier panel showing the younger character with another individual, possibly a friend or peer, discussing the upcoming meeting with a degree of nervousness and anticipation.  The overall tone suggests a formal but ultimately positive outcome for the student's work-study request.
