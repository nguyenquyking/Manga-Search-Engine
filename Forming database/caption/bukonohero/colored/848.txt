The character appears distressed, possibly injured, with dark markings on his hands.  Red scratch-like effects are prominent across the background, suggesting destruction or a powerful attack. The text boxes indicate a sense of relief or resolution, describing a past yearning and the subsequent disappearance of an "itch." The overall mood is somber yet conclusive.  The words "DOOM" are visible, adding to the intense atmosphere. The bottom mentions the next chapter's release date.
