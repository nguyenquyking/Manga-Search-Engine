A heavily scarred, white-haired man with a gaping mouth stands amidst fiery debris.  His body is extensively lacerated, revealing stitched-up flesh. He is shouting, expressing indifference to others' understanding. Speech bubbles indicate his defiance ("I don't care if you don't understand...") and his statement that "That's what makes us...heroes and villains."  The scene is dark and gritty, highlighting the character's intense emotional state. The artist's signature, "HEXAMENDLE," is visible in the bottom right corner.  No other characters are present.
