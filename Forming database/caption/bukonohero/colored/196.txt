A manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A character with white and grey hair sits, back to the viewer, observing a doorway.  Through the doorway, another character with spiky blonde hair and dark clothing is visible. A third character, with red hair and dark clothing, is partially shown in a lower panel, seemingly reacting to the scene.  The white-haired character appears contemplative, possibly reflecting on past events as indicated by the speech bubbles. The overall tone suggests betrayal or conflict, with the phrase "mortal enemy" highlighting the animosity between individuals.
