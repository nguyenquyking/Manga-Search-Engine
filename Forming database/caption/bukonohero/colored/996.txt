A colored manga panel depicts a scene with multiple characters and dialogue boxes.  A young boy, possibly Izuku Midoriya, wearing a teal hooded costume and a face mask, is shown in the top panel, seemingly distressed.  The text bubble above him reads, "Chase too far and you'll just make him harder to catch."  Another bubble shows him being told, "C'mon, let's respect sir's orders". The middle panel shows a pair of legs walking away, with a text bubble stating, "Kurono, prepare my bath" and another stating, "The kids these days are more disease-ridden than ever." The bottom panel shows two characters, one with dark purple hair and a dark green jacket, appearing apologetic to a taller figure wearing a bird-like mask.  The masked figure is likely the Capo.  The apologetic character says, "I... I'm sorry, Capo!!" and explains that he looked away for a moment and the kid ran away. The overall tone suggests a tense situation involving a chase and a subordinate apologizing for a failure.
