My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A severely injured, white-haired villain lies on the ground, bleeding profusely.  He is surrounded by debris from a large-scale explosion shown in the background.  Two heroes, possibly Deku (Midoriya Izuku) and Bakugo (Katsuki Bakugo), stand in the background observing the villain.  The villain's dialogue expresses resentment towards the heroes for prioritizing ideals over protecting their own families.  The heroes seem to be contemplating the villain's words. The scene is set against a backdrop of a large fiery explosion and rubble.
