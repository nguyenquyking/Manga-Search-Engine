My Hero Academia Chapter 325 depicts a scene where Midoriya, a young boy, is crying and apologizing.  Another boy, similarly distressed, is also present.  A woman with a horse-like mask is seen in the background, having apparently intervened in a prior event.  The dialogue boxes indicate Midoriya's attempt to emulate a heroic figure and his remorse for his actions. The overall mood is one of emotional vulnerability and regret.
