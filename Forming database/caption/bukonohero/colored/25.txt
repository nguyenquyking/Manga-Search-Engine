A nighttime scene in a devastated city shows several monstrous figures confronting a lone, dark-cloaked hero.  In the background, civilians are seen fleeing amidst the rubble.  A panel shows a masked figure, possibly Iguchi, stating, "Know this, Iguchi... everyone can be somebody's hero."  The monstrous figures vary in appearance; one is large and green, another is brown and humanoid, and a third is plant-like and tall. The hero, clad in dark clothing, stands poised for action.  The overall mood is tense and dramatic.
