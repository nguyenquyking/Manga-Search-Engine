Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A blond-haired character, possibly a Devil Fruit user, unleashes a powerful energy blast, shattering rocks around multiple figures.  Other characters are shown scattered on a rocky terrain, possibly during a battle.  One character is seen using a technique to avoid collateral damage (friendly fire).  The scene is dynamic and filled with onomatopoeia illustrating the force of the attack.
