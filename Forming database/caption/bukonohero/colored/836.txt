A manga scene depicting a distressed young man, possibly named Mon, struggling to breathe and speak, while a young girl, possibly Ana, looks on with concern and guilt.  The girl initially apologizes, revealing a secret she kept.  The man's intense exertion is emphasized by "Huff" speech bubbles.  The girl's subsequent worry and a later panel showing her running and screaming suggest a serious situation unfolding.  A final panel shows a dark scene with the girl screaming in terror near a possibly injured or deceased person or animal.
