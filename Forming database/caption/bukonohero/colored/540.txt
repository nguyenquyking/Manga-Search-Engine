One Piece manga panel depicting a large, swirling, grey and ice-like structure.  A character with grey hair surfs on a large piece of ice, seemingly riding the structure's movement. Another character, possibly injured, is seen below, fighting or observing the spectacle.  A third character,  with a cube-like head and mouth agape, is shown in a separate panel,  expressing determination with the text  "...we must stake our lives on the job!" The overall scene is dynamic and chaotic, with motion lines indicating movement and impact.  The text "Whatever happens..." appears in a speech bubble. The background shows a mountainous landscape.
