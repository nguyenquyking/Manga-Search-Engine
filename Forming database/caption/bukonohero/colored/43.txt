Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panels:  A colossal blue figure, possibly a powerful enemy or awakened Devil Fruit user, looms in the sky.  A blond-haired character in a striped suit, possibly a hero or admiral, initiates a countdown ("Here's the count-down!"), initiating an attack.  Three panels depict the subsequent destruction of several dark, jet-like aircraft as the blue figure counts down ("Three!", "Two!", "One!"), showcasing a powerful energy beam or attack.  The final panel shows the aftermath, possibly implying a successful attack.
