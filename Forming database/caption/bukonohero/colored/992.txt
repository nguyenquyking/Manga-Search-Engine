My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A dark-haired man with a bird-like mask (likely Twice) sighs, expressing exasperation.  Another character, seemingly distressed, kneels on the ground.  A third character, possibly a hero in a red cape, observes the scene.  A subsequent panel shows a conversation between three characters, seemingly involving a female character being comforted and a discussion about a sensitive situation.  Twice is shown again, suggesting a desire for a private discussion.  The overall tone is one of concern and hushed urgency.
