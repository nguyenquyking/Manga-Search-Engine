Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  **Panel 1:** Shoto Todoroki, with his dual-colored hair (white and red), mouths wide open in a fierce expression, amidst a destroyed urban landscape.  **Panel 2:** Izuku Midoriya, severely injured and bleeding profusely from the face, is shown in a dynamic action sequence.  His hair is spiking outward, and a large, dark hand (presumably from an opponent) is striking him.  The overall visual effect suggests intense physical combat.
