Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A dynamic manga panel depicts intense combat.  A character with dark clothing is slammed into the ground ("SLAM"). Another character, with light gray hair and ornate gold jewelry, glares ("GLARE").  A third character, possibly Endeavor (from My Hero Academia, given the art style and fire abilities), unleashes a powerful fiery attack ("FOOSH"), creating a large explosion and pushing against a powerful force represented by a purple energy blast ("FWUSH"). The scene is filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia, emphasizing the speed and force of the attacks.  The overall style suggests a clash of significant power between multiple combatants.
