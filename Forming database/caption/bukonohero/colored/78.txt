Tomura Shigaraki, a blonde-haired man in a dark jacket and jeans, stands in the foreground.  Behind him are two figures in dark uniforms; one appears to be a man, the other a person with a cat-like head covering.  Shigaraki is the focal point, and the scene suggests a conversation regarding a schedule and a vessel that will be complete in three days. The background is dark and indistinct.
