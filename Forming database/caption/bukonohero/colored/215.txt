A manga panel depicts a conversation between several characters.  One character, with long dark hair, observes another who appears to need saving.  Another scene shows two characters, one with bright green hair, seemingly connected emotionally. A third panel shows a muscular man with goggles and a third character, also with dark hair and a cape, standing before a seated, red-haired man in a throne-like chair.  The dialogue suggests the characters are discussing the suffering of someone whose body is being controlled, and the fact that the controlled individual isn't looking for help.  The visual style is consistent with action-adventure manga.
