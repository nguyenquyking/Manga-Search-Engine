Impact sound effects ("FWAH") are visible.  **Panel 2:** A large, muscular figure (possibly an antagonist) is engulfed in a blue energy explosion marked with "BOOM" sound effects.  **Panel 3:**  A group of characters manning cannons, including Kirishima, are shown. A text bubble states: "Red Riot Kirishima really did it! Red Riot successfully administered a dose!"  **Panel 4:** A character (possibly an antagonist) with icy blue energy surrounding them experiences a visible effect. A text bubble explains: "The more he moves around, the faster the drug should work!" The word "Majestic!" is also present.  Another character appears to be assisting in applying the effect.  The panel shows a powerful energy effect with "FWOOOM" sound effects.  The image depicts a battle scene, likely focusing on Kirishima successfully administering a drug or substance to an enemy. The visual style is dynamic, with emphasis on action and energy effects.
