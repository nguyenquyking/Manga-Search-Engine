A female character with short, blue hair, wearing a dark outfit and futuristic boots, stands holding a large, uniquely designed weapon.  She commands, "Come quietly..." A smaller, male character in a light-colored shirt is visibly intimidated, in the background.  The weapon is propped up on what appears to be fleshy, red supports. Rain falls. Text indicates the woman is "A hired gun...sent by All for One."  The scene suggests a tense confrontation or ambush.
