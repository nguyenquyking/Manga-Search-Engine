Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dynamic manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  Shoto Todoroki, using his ice powers, unleashes "Rupture" and "Liquification +" attacks, creating shards of ice that pierce and shatter the stone-like defenses of a muscular, fire-wielding opponent (likely Endeavor, though this is not explicitly confirmed).  Todoroki is shown with a bloody wound on his face.  The scene is filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia indicating impact and force. The overall visual style is action-packed and dramatic.
