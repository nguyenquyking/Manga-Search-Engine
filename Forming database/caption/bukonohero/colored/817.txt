One Piece manga panel depicting a post-fight scene.  A severely injured, orange-haired man wheezes on the ground, blood staining the earth around him.  A bloodied, silver-haired man stands over him, appearing relatively unscathed but also wounded. The silver-haired man questions why they fought, referencing the orange-haired man's self-inflicted injuries.  The dialogue indicates a brutal fight where the orange-haired combatant severely injured himself before collapsing. The overall tone is grim and violent.
