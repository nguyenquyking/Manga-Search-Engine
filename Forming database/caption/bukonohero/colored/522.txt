A giant, monstrous figure with dark purple spiky hair and large fangs slams into the ground amidst a forest, creating a large crater.  Several smaller figures, possibly Straw Hats, are shown being affected by the impact. The onomatopoeia "SLAM" and large stylized impact sounds are present. The scene suggests a powerful attack causing significant damage. The bottom panel shows a group of characters, possibly fleeing or reacting to the attack.
