Manga panel depicting a confrontation. A large, enraged figure, possibly a villain, expresses anger and frustration at being close to  Kurogiri's friend. The villain's quirk is a duplicate of his original, and he reveals his rage at not having access to "Erasure."  A smaller character, possibly a hero, is also shown, possibly  representing "Erasure".  The panels suggest a flashback to a past encounter and raise questions about a quirk's longevity.  The scene is tense and dramatic.
