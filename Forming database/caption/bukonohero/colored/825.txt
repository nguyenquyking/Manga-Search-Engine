A colorized manga panel depicts a character, seemingly a young man with long, white hair, walking across a dark, rocky landscape. He is barefoot and wears tattered dark clothing that resembles a large cloak or cape with feathered edges.  His expression is serious.  A speech bubble above him reads, "Just gotta destroy it all before you connect. It's no big deal." The background is a muted grey-blue, with texture suggesting destruction or decay.  The overall mood is dark and ominous.  No other characters are visible.
