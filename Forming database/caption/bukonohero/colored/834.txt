A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a young man with dark hair, crying while holding a dog-like creature. The creature is transforming or decaying, with dark, viscous substance emanating from it.  The man's emotional distress is evident in his tearful face and the way he clutches the creature. The word "Whimper" is in a speech bubble above the creature in the first panel.  The final panel shows the man's face in close-up, eyes wide with shock and tears streaming down his face.  The words "Plop, Plop" appear beneath the creature's dissolving form, suggesting the creature is disintegrating.
