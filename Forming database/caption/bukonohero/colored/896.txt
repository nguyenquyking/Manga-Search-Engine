A manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya's (Deku) uncontrolled power surge resulting in unexpected high-speed movement.  He expresses surprise at his own actions, noting the similarity to All Might's New Hampshire Smash. The force of his movement creates a shockwave, observed by another character (possibly Katsuki Bakugo, partially obscured).
