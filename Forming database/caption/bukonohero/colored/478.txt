Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image panels:  **Panel 1:** A young, light-blue haired boy walks alone amidst a crowd of indistinct, shadowy figures in a city street.  The boy appears vulnerable and isolated.  **Panel 2:** An older woman with white hair, a man in a jacket, and other indistinct people walk in a city street.  A speech bubble suggests hope that the police or a hero can help someone.  **Panel 3:**  A split panel. The left side shows a partly cloudy sky; a speech bubble mentions that problems build up over time. The right side shows a close-up of a character's face, revealing a weathered and distressed expression, possibly due to internal decay.  Speech bubbles indicate the system is rotten inside, with maggots crawling out.  The character appears to be experiencing significant internal conflict or physical deterioration.
