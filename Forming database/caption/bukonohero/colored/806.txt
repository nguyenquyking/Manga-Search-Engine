My analysis of the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  The image depicts several panels showcasing a conversation and internal monologue.  Shigaraki Tomura is shown prominently, his face scarred and his eyes glowing.  Text emphasizes his power, suggesting he's amassed strength comparable to, or even exceeding, that of pro heroes.  The narrative highlights his connection to Feel Good Inc. and their control over a vast network, implying a significant power structure and resources at his disposal.  Another panel shows a large army of soldiers under his command.  A final panel reveals a character (possibly a hero) reacting with alarm upon seeing Shigaraki.  The overall tone is ominous, emphasizing Shigaraki's growing power and threat.
