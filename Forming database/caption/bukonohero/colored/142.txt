Manga panel depicting a character, possibly a villain or anti-hero, whose appearance is described in the text bubbles.  He is heavily scarred and wears a bandage covering his eyes and much of his face. His tongue is visible, sticking out slightly.  He is shown in a close-up shot, and there are smaller panels showing a rain-soaked city and what appears to be a scene of action or a disaster, possibly related to his powers. The text discusses his ability to appear silently, possessing multiple quirks, resembling a Nomu (a type of creature from the My Hero Academia universe), and his contradictory reputation for helping people despite his violent appearance.  The overall tone suggests mystery and intrigue surrounding the character's identity and actions.
