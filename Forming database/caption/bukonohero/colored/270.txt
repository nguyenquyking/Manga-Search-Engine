A young boy with white hair, possibly Ace, demonstrates his fiery abilities in a snowy forest setting.  He is showcasing intensely bright flames, significantly larger than previous displays.  He declares his flames are strong and that he can surpass someone, possibly his father, who is implied but not visually present. The boy's emotional state is one of determination and perhaps defiance, shown by his tears and forceful statement. The overall scene highlights a power-demonstration within a melancholic, wintery environment.
