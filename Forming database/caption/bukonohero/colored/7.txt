One Piece manga panel depicting a large, monstrous sea creature being attacked.  Water splashes and impact effects surround the creature, which is shown screaming ("BWAaah!" and "AHH!").  Smaller figures, possibly Fish-Men, are seen in the background launching an attack.  A speech bubble notes their significant upgrades since the Jakku arc. The scene is dynamic and action-packed, focusing on the intense battle.
