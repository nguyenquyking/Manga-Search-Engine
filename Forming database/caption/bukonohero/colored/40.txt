A manga panel depicts a conversation between several characters.  Two muscular men, one dark-skinned and one light-skinned, discuss a blonde woman's abilities.  The dark-skinned man states her strength is simply her quirk. The light-skinned man agrees, adding that comparing her to All Might is the problem. The blonde woman, shown in a close-up, appears to be amused and slightly injured, indicated by a bandage.  The scene's context suggests a discussion about the blonde woman's strength and her comparison to a powerful figure.  The panel also contains text bubbles displaying the characters' dialogue.
