A manga panel depicting the aftermath of a battle. A character, possibly Overhaul, with long white hair, stands amidst the ruins of a large, damaged industrial machine.  The machine is heavily damaged, with broken pipes and smoking components, suggesting recent destruction.  The character appears to be observing the devastation, their expression reflecting disappointment or concern.  The words "DARN..." and "OVERHAUL WOULD BE SO DISAPPOINTED" are in speech bubbles nearby, indicating their internal monologue. Another panel shows the character interacting with a damaged control panel or console, possibly further inspecting the damage. The onomatopoeia "WHOOSH," "TREMBL," "KAKLANG," and "KLANG" highlight the sounds of destruction and the character's actions.  The overall scene is desolate and emphasizes the scale of the destruction.
