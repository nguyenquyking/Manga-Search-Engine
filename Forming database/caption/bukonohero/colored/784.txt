A colored manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A female character, possibly a villain, with long white hair and rabbit-like ears, is shown in a close-up, grinning menacingly with blood on her mouth. She's wearing a light-colored, form-fitting top and dark bottoms.  She's positioned inside what seems like a technological structure or machine.  Text bubbles indicate she's taunting an unseen opponent who is deeper inside a lair, described as an "old fart."  The background suggests a futuristic or mechanical setting. The opponent's arm is partially visible, also showing signs of struggle or damage.  Speed lines and onomatopoeia ("HNNNGH," "WGGL") enhance the dynamic action of the scene.
