A manga panel depicting a powerful energy attack. A colossal figure wields a massive, bright blue "United Hyper-Max Output Laser."  The laser is fired downwards, creating a large crater.  A smaller figure, possibly a superhero with a red, white, and blue costume, looks upward with a determined expression, seemingly having initiated the combined attack. The text indicates the beams are combining into one powerful blast.  The scene suggests a climactic moment of battle with significant destructive power.
