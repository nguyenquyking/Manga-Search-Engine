A manga panel depicting Himiko Toga.  The scene is set in a dilapidated, dark room with graffiti reading "You'll Pay" and "Idiot Vampire".  Toga is shown in multiple panels:  one where she's partially obscured, another showing her face with a distressed expression, and a final panel showing her walking down a hallway.  The other characters are unseen but their dialogue expresses concern and disapproval of Toga's actions and lifestyle.  The overall mood is tense and confrontational.
