A manga panel depicting a dramatic internal conflict.  The top panel shows a bright green-haired character (likely Izuku Midoriya) seemingly engaged in a fight, with a person in white clothing.  The middle panel is a close-up of Midoriya's determined, yet troubled expression. The bottom panel showcases a dark-haired character (possibly a villain or antagonist), whose face is partially obscured, with a serious expression.  The speech bubbles reveal an internal debate regarding the necessity of lethal action against a seemingly helpless individual.  The overall tone is dark and intense, focusing on a moral dilemma.
