Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga panel suitable for vector embedding:  A three-panel sequence depicting intense action. Panel one shows a close-up of a character's intense, wide-eyed face, possibly experiencing pain or exertion; the word "THROB" appears twice, indicating a physical sensation.  Panel two shows a fiery, powerful figure, possibly using a fire-based attack, with the words "HELL'S..." suggesting the scale of the attack.  Panel three displays a large, swirling vortex of dark purple energy consuming a cityscape; the words "...ALL..." suggest the attack's scope and destructive nature.  The overall tone is one of dramatic action and impending destruction.
