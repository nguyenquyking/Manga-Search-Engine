One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  A hospitalized man with short dark hair and bandages is shown lying in a hospital bed.  He's being addressed by at least two other individuals, one of whom appears to be a tall, slender man with light skin and short, dark hair, dressed in a formal jacket. Another is a man with blond hair and a dark jacket. The dialogue boxes reveal discussions about intelligence failures, a rescue mission gone wrong, bioengineered creatures, and a long-term strategy involving the hospitalized man. The overall scene suggests a clandestine operation and a mission to expose a shadow organization.
