A colossal, muscular figure in dark clothing, seemingly made of stone, is shown falling or stomping downwards, creating a large impact.  The word "TOMP" is repeated in onomatopoeia style, emphasizing the force of the impact.  Smaller figures are visible below, seemingly affected by the fall.  The text "He's not going anywhere!" is included, along with a release date for the next chapter.  The scene is highly dynamic and depicts a powerful display of strength.
