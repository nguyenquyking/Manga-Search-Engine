A blond-haired character, seemingly a military commander, is shown in various panels.  The first panel depicts them standing on a futuristic aircraft, possibly a jet, adorned with a stylized American flag.  Subsequent panels show close-ups of their face, revealing a serious expression.  The dialogue boxes indicate a discussion about a powerful enemy ("regenerating scumbag," "this punk") who has become a global threat, requiring immediate action ("make him dead now").  The commander is considering deploying special authority and communicating the situation to Commander Agpar.  The overall tone suggests an urgent, militaristic response to a serious threat.
