Here's a caption describing the provided image:  A manga-style illustration depicts Himiko Toga embracing a dissolving Tomura Shigaraki. Toga is shown in a hug, expressing gratitude with a speech bubble reading "Thank you for saving me."  Shigaraki's body is disintegrating into dark, viscous liquid. A separate speech bubble above Toga asks, "Could a guy ask for a better life?" The art style is reminiscent of My Hero Academia.
