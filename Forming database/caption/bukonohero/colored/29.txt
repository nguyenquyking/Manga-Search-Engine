My Hero Academia manga panel depicting the aftermath of a battle.  The top panel shows the remnants of the Liberation Front, a group of escaped convicts serving All For One. The middle panels show a cityscape damaged by the conflict. The bottom panels feature a conversation between two characters, one with spiky white hair and a dark mask (likely Hawks), and the other with blond hair (likely Endeavor). They discuss the remaining threat posed by the Liberation Front and the likelihood of them gaining more allies, acknowledging the recent death of a hero ("Star").  The overall tone is serious and somber.
