My Hero Academia Chapter 281: Plus Ultra.  A severely injured, light-haired man is shown in the upper panel,  groaning ("HFF...", "KRK", "WOBBL") while speech bubbles reveal that heroes "pretend to be society's guardians."  The lower panel depicts Endeavor (in flames), Bakugo, and Deku amidst a smoky, devastated landscape.  Endeavor states that their actions have "tainted everything you've built," while another speech bubble reveals that for generations, heroes pretended not to see those they couldn't protect, sweeping their pain "under the rug."
