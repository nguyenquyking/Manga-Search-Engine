Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panels:  A group of characters, including a muscular woman with dark hair, restrain a young man with white hair, while another character observes.  The speech bubble reads "Don't ever forget." In the following panel, a close-up shows a character with wide, red-rimmed eyes, indicating shock or surprise. The final panel shows the white-haired young man unleashing a powerful attack, with the word "Enough" in a speech bubble.  The scene is violent, suggesting a confrontation or conflict.  The art style is reminiscent of One Piece, with dynamic action lines and expressive character designs.
