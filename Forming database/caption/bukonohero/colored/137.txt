A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blond-haired character, possibly All Might, in a dark jacket and sunglasses, observes a large, dark, shadowy figure emitting green energy.  A smaller figure in a cloak flees a nearby explosion near an "Art Mus" building. All Might is surprised, exclaiming "He won!!". The text indicates a concern about the shadowy figure potentially exploding.  The scene is set outdoors in rainy conditions.
