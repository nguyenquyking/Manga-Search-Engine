Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga-style comic image suitable for vector embedding:  A three-panel comic depicting a dramatic battle scene.  Panel one shows a bridge lowering in heavy rain. Panel two shows multiple Cottus units deploying amidst rain and gunfire.  Panel three shows a fierce close-quarters combat scene, with energy blasts and a character (possibly Luffy) engaged in a violent attack marked “Targeting to Kill.” The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
