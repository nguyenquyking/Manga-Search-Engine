One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A woman with silver hair, possibly a significant character, is shown in close-up, described as "strong... but prone to melting away at the slightest touch." She's in a garden setting near a pond with blue flowers.  A man with reddish-brown hair, seemingly her husband, observes her, commenting on the flowers' beauty and her reaction to them.  In a previous panel, the same man and woman, alongside another man and woman, are shown in a formal setting, suggesting a forced marriage. The text reveals the woman knew it was a "quirk marriage" from the start but proceeded for her family. The scene emphasizes the contrast between the woman's outward strength and her inner vulnerability.  The overall mood is melancholic and suggestive of a complex relationship.
