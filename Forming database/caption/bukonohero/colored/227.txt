Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A close-up of Izuku Midoriya, eyes wide with determination and tears, clenches his fists.  He's wearing a yellow shirt.  Text bubbles reveal his internal conflict: he wants to save someone, but questions if killing is the only option. A background panel shows a powerful, golden, possibly villainous entity crying.  Another panel depicts other characters observing a dark, ominous scene.
