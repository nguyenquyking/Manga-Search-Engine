Manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters analyzing intercepted radio waves.  A man with dark hair observes a waveform on a monitor.  A cat-like character with orange fur expresses surprise ("Oh").  Another character, possibly All Might, is shown reacting to a message, "Make him complete in 38 days," questioning the timeline. The conversation centers around the decoding of radio waves used as signals and the possibility of manipulated research results.  The Nomu is referenced, implying a connection to villain activity.
