Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  The image depicts a dramatic scene from a manga, likely a superhero genre.  Three characters are shown in separate panels. The first panel shows two characters, one wearing a teal helmet and another with pink hair, reacting to news on a computer screen displaying an image of a hero.  The pink-haired character is shown angrily shouting in subsequent panels, expressing disbelief and condemning those who remain loyal to Endeavor. The final panel shows a violent scene; a figure, possibly Hawks (the number two hero), is brutally attacking another character, who is bleeding profusely and lying on the ground.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed, focused on betrayal, doubt, and violence.
