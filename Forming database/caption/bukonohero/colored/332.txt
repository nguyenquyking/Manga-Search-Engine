Close-up of a stylized manga character, possibly Shoto, engulfed in a swirling vortex of blue and purple flames.  The character's expression is intense, and their face is partially obscured by the fiery effect. Speech bubbles reveal thoughts of anticipation ("...I WONDER...") and a threat ("SHOTO!! ONCE MY FIRE BURNS YOU TO ASH..."). Another thought bubble expresses concern about a "dad's" reaction ("...WHAT KINDA FACE DAD'LL MAKE?!"). The background is predominantly blue with fiery orange kanji characters scattered throughout. The overall style is dynamic and dramatic, suggesting a moment of intense power and conflict.
