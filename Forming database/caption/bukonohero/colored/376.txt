A colossal, muscular, earth-toned figure, possibly a giant or powerful enemy, is shown amidst a chaotic scene of shattered ice.  Red, energy-like shards emanate from its body. In the foreground, several characters are battling the effects of the destruction.  One character in orange and black clothing runs away from the collapsing ice. Another, seemingly in a futuristic suit, carries a smaller character who appears injured. A small, dark-haired character is seen lying on the ground, potentially knocked down by the destruction.  A smaller figure in purple clothing can be seen flying in the top left corner, possibly a supporting character engaged in a separate action. The overall scene suggests a powerful attack or a major battle.
