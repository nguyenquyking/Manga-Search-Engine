One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a character, seemingly Toya, observes Izuku Midoriya's return to U.A. High School.  Toya's speech bubbles express frustration at the delay of an unspecified event and highlight a perceived advantage he possesses.  The panel showcases U.A. High, depicted as a large, sturdy building, contrasting with a dark, cavernous setting where Toya is located. A bright light emanates from a cave entrance behind Toya.  Visual emphasis is placed on the contrast between the bright, hopeful image of U.A. and the dark, ominous setting surrounding Toya.
