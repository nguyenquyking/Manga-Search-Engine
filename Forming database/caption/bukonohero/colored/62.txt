A manga panel depicts All Might (in his golden age form) obliterating an unnamed villain.  All Might's hand is shown clapping, reducing the villain to atoms, creating a large crater in the sea below. The narration indicates that killing the villain was the only way to prevent him from revealing All Might's real name. The final panel shows the villain disintegrating into particles.
