My analysis of the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  **Panel 1:** Endeavor confronts someone (likely another pro-hero) about allowing Deku and All Might to work together.  Endeavor's expression is angry and accusatory.  **Panel 2:** A flashback or memory shows Deku, Bakugo, Todoroki, and another character (possibly Uraraka).  The text suggests this was the "right move" despite the circumstances.  **Panel 3:**  A conversation between Endeavor (implied) and a muscular character (likely a pro-hero). The dialogue reveals that the muscular pro-hero is criticized for his lack of self-reflection and perceived recklessness, and is contrasted with All Might's approach.  **Panel 4:**  Deku is shown from behind, seemingly reacting to the previous conversation. The final speech bubble suggests a reflection on Deku's character.  The muscular character in this panel, and the previous panel, is likely a symbol of a different mindset in heroism.  The contrast between this character and All Might's mindset is central to the scene's meaning.
