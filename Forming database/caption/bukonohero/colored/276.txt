A dramatic two-panel One Piece manga scene depicting intense combat.  Panel one shows a large mecha-like robot under heavy fire, with explosions and energy blasts.  A soldier-like character, possibly a marine, is seen crouching nearby, appearing to be in the midst of battle. The text indicates a "Code Red Security Alert." Panel two shows the aftermath; the robot, Briareos, is defeated and lying on the ground. Another character expresses grief, stating that Briareos has been killed.  The scene is filled with visual effects representing energy blasts and impacts, with rain in the background. The overall tone is one of chaos and significant loss.
