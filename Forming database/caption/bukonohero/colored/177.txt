My analysis of the provided One Piece manga image depicts a discussion regarding Shigaraki's body and All For One's plans.  The scene shows multiple panels with text boxes revealing the characters' thoughts and dialogue.  A key element is the focus on Shigaraki's incomplete body and the process of transferring him into a new, more powerful form.  The discussion points out that Shigaraki was activated before his body was fully complete. All For One's next goal is implied to be the acquisition of One For All.  Notably, All Might's defeat is referenced. While no specific character names other than Shigaraki and All Might are explicitly mentioned in the image, All For One's involvement is strongly implied.
