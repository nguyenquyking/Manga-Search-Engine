A manga panel depicting a distressed Ochaco Uraraka, struggling with intense emotions.  She's shown in multiple scenes: initially expressing her overwhelming desire to absorb others' blood, then engaging in a physical altercation with another character, possibly during a fight.  Later panels show her reflecting on a past traumatic encounter with a woman who deemed her "normal" state as sad and miserable, culminating in an attempted murder.  The overall tone conveys Ochaco's internal conflict and the difficulty she faces coping with her emotions.
