Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga image:  A muscular, large, humanoid figure with spiky brown hair rises, holding a knife.  His attire consists of dark pants and a dark-colored forearm guard. To the left, a close-up shows a monstrous face, possibly a creature, sniffing and displaying a thought bubble that reads "Master's Scent." The text "He stood up!" accompanies the figure's rising action.  A caption at the bottom reads "Next chapter hits May 24!".
