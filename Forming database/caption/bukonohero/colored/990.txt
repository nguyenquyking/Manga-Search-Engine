A colored manga panel depicts a scene with several characters.  Izuku Midoriya comforts a frightened, small girl clutching him tightly.  Another character observes, commenting on the girl's unusual calmness and the bandages she wears.  A third character, seemingly a villain, is shown separately, and another is seen arguing with Midoriya about the situation. The overall theme centers on the unusual behavior of the girl and the differing opinions of the other characters regarding the situation.  The text bubbles contain dialogue focusing on the girl's fear, the unusual nature of her silence, and the potential implications of intervening.
