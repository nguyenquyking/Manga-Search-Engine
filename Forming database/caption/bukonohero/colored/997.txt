My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  Overhaul (in a dark green coat and bird-like mask) is present, and he's stated to be cleaning up a mess.  Another character, possibly a doctor in a white coat and bird-like mask, holds a young girl (Eri) who appears distressed.  The text indicates that those involved are suffering from “Chronic Heroism.”  Overhaul is reprimanding Eri, telling her to stop being selfish. The background shows blood splatter and damage, suggesting a prior violent event.
