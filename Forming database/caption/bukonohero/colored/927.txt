Here's a concise caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  Two characters, one with dark hair and a scarf (likely a supporting character), and another with blond hair and glasses (main character), discuss the limitations of the blond-haired character's foresight ability. The ability allows viewing a target person's actions for one hour, but only from a nearby perspective and with a 24-hour cooldown.  The panel includes illustrations depicting the ability's output as a series of film frames playing in the blond-haired character's mind.
