A chaotic battle scene unfolds amidst crumbling ruins.  Multiple characters are engaged in combat,  with purple energy blasts and flying debris filling the scene. One character is shown falling from a great height, narrating their descent. The text indicates a feeling of being tricked ("Getting duped.") and the insignificance of life in the face of such overwhelming power.  The second panel shows a purple cape falling to the ground with blood splatters, suggesting a character's defeat or death.  Specific character names are not discernible from the provided image.
