A close-up manga panel depicts a confrontation between Enji Todoroki (Endeavor) and his son.  Endeavor, heavily wounded and bloody, challenges his son to a fight, stating "So let's tango, you and me-Enji Todoroki!!"  His son, also injured, responds, "Get it, yet?! Y'reap what you sow!"  Endeavor adds, "A dance with your son, here in hell!!" The scene is intense, highlighting the conflict between father and son. A subsequent panel shows a city scene with motion lines suggesting an upcoming action sequence.  The text "Next chapter hits Nov. 15!" indicates a continuation of the story.
