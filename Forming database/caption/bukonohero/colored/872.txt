This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a conversation between two characters: a blond-haired character (likely Hawks) and a dark-haired character with stitched facial scars (likely Dabi).  The dialogue reveals a disagreement about a Nomu test.  Hawks points out the Nomu's superior capabilities and the prior lack of notification. Dabi explains his change of plans and that the test was to gauge trust.  The final panel shows Dabi and Hawks in a nighttime urban setting near a factory, highlighting a post-test interaction.  The overall scene is tense and suggestive of a strained alliance.
