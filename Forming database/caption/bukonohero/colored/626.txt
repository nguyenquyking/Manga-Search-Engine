A One Piece manga panel depicts a character with white hair and severe facial damage, possibly from a recent battle.  He expresses dissatisfaction, questioning why he feels this way after obtaining a powerful force.  Narrative boxes explain that this power defied his control, a key component of the "All for One" sought-after ability. The final panel shows the character reaching towards a powerful, fiery energy burst, indicating a continuing struggle or pursuit of something beyond his initial goal.  The overall tone is one of internal conflict and unresolved ambition.
