A manga panel depicting a colossal, scarred figure with white hair, possibly All for One,  in a destructive pose.  His expression is menacing, and his hand is shown crushing a building.  In the background, a city is in ruins.  Smaller panels show Giran running, seemingly fleeing from the larger figure. Giran says, "It's been years since I had to run anywhere."  Another panel shows a smaller character, possibly a hero,  being attacked by a dark-haired figure, possibly a villain, amidst electrical energy. Text bubbles read "Get moving, Giran!" "Don't fear," and "Re-Destro!" The overall scene suggests a powerful villain causing widespread destruction.
