One Piece manga panel depicting a dark, intense scene. A character, possibly a cyborg or robot, is shown partially decayed, with purple energy crackling around them. Text suggests a struggle between opposing forces ("hatred and delight").  Another character, seemingly smaller and engulfed in darkness, is present.  The larger characterâ€™s decay is spreading rapidly, implying a limited range of attack. A central, glowing orb is labelled "true freedom," suggesting a thematic element of control and liberation. The setting is dark and ominous, with rubble and debris surrounding the characters.  No specific character names are visible.
