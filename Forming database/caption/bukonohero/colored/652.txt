Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panels:  A large ice structure collapses near Gunga Mountain Villa, approximately 80km from Jaku Hospital.  Multiple characters are caught in the debris.  Subsequent panels show a close-up of Fat Gum (in his hero costume) reacting to a fast-moving figure (possibly Hawks) who is carrying or approaching him.  Fat Gum exclaims "Whoa! Just a sec!" while Hawks calls out "Fat Gum!"  The scene is dynamic, emphasizing speed and impact.
