Here's a concise caption describing the provided One Piece manga-style comic image:  Multiple panels depict intense combat scenes.  A small figure, seemingly subservient, addresses a large, muscular antagonist.  Elsewhere, Hawks (injured and exhausted) battles Shigaraki, who appears unfazed.  Shoto Todoroki is also shown in combat.  The overall tone is one of intense struggle and desperation.  The style mimics the visual aesthetics of One Piece and My Hero Academia manga.
