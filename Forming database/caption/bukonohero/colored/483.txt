A manga panel depicting intense combat.  A severely injured, white-haired fighter, possibly pushing his limits, is the focus of the first panel.  He is shown with a bloody face and violent motion lines. The second panel shows a battered, yellow-suited character, seemingly in worse condition. The third panel shows a brutal attack; a winged character strikes down a bloodied opponent; onomatopoeia "KRNCH" depicts the impact. The final panel depicts a close-up of a yellow-gloved hand grabbing another character's arm.  The text suggests the struggle is exhausting for both fighters.
