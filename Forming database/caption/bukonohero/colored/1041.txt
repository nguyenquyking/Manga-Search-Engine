A colored manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  A light blue-haired character, possibly Tomura Shigaraki, is shown in the first panel, covering his face with his hands, reacting to another character's action.  The second panel shows a muscular man with brown hair and sunglasses, carrying a large object resembling a weapon or tool, telling Shigaraki to leave.  The third panel shows a narrative caption about the man's past friendship, and another panel shows a smaller character being attacked by a purple energy blast.  The overall scene is tense and action-oriented, with dialogue indicating a confrontation and past relationships.
