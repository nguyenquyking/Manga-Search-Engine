My Hero Academia Chapter 277 cover and panels:  A close-up depicts a dynamic struggle between Shigaraki and another character (likely Eraser Head).  Shigaraki's face is partially obscured, showing intense emotion.  Energetic lines suggest a powerful clash.  Smaller panels show Shigaraki, a surprised older man (likely Aizawa), and a text box declaring "the worst-case scenario". Text states that as long as Shigaraki's quirks are erased, they can join the fight.
