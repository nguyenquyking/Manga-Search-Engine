A manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters and actions.  A character with white hair experiences a severe headache, their head splitting ("...splitting").  Their face is contorted in pain.  Another panel shows a hawk-like figure, possibly a villain, commenting on the activation of a power ("I thought it took five fingers to activate...").  A woman, possibly a mother, is shown concerned, offering eye drops ("Mother! You've rubbed your eyes all ragged...let's get you some drops").  The overall tone suggests a moment of intense pain and concern.
