This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a tense interaction between Katsuki Bakugo (Kacchan) and Izuku Midoriya (Deku).  Bakugo, with spiky blond hair and a fiery expression, aggressively suggests killing Midoriya instead of the other way around. Midoriya, with green hair and wide, fearful eyes, initially reacts in surprise and then thanks Bakugo for seemingly offering assistance. The scene shifts to show a chaotic battle scene in the background, emphasizing the urgency. Bakugo later dismisses Midoriya's perceived self-importance with a sarcastic comment and continues to pursue his objectives.  The overall mood is one of conflict and underlying tension between the two characters.
