A manga panel depicting a young man with long, white hair, exhibiting disheveled appearance and a distressed expression, amidst a destroyed cityscape.  He questions his location ("Where am I...?").  The scene suggests a powerful event has occurred, with debris and destruction surrounding him. In subsequent panels, the young man, seemingly shirtless with dark pants, stands amidst the rubble, a small girl floating on a piece of land nearby.  The dialogue reveals the character is questioning his father's previous claims ("Daddy said all that stuff, but..."). The overall tone is one of confusion and possibly disbelief in the face of devastation.
