A manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A distressed woman with dark hair and glasses, possibly a hero, states, "...put him to sleep!"  Another female character, possibly a younger hero, looks shocked and concerned, saying "I don't understand, Sensei!!"  In the background, a group of people are running, possibly fleeing.  A villain, possibly a large, powerful being, is being pursued.  One panel shows a skeletal figure, possibly a villain's minion, and declares "She's mine." The situation appears urgent and dangerous, with a discussion about sedating the villain to prevent further harm.  The panel also references Jiro's sound waves and Shoji's eyes, suggesting a coordinated effort by heroes.
