Close-up of clasped hands, appearing to belong to a character in a light grey/white glove with maroon accents on the cuffs.  The hands are the central focus, with a blurred, shadowy figure in the background. A speech bubble states, "...ARE FRIENDS TO SPARE."  No specific character names are visible.  The style suggests a manga or comic book panel.
