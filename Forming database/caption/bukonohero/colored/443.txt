A manga panel depicting a powerful, destructive attack labeled "SMASH!!" and "TEXAS...".  A character, possibly Izuku Midoriya (based on visual style), is shown severely injured, with blood and a glowing green energy emanating from a wound.  Other characters, possibly Katsuki Bakugo and another unnamed character, observe the scene with expressions of concern and determination.  Text bubbles indicate the observers' astonishment and a discussion of strategies to counter the attack or subdue the injured character.  The overall scene suggests a intense battle with high stakes.
