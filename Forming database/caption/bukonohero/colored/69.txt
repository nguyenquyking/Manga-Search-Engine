A manga-style comic panel depicting a prison riot or escape.  A character with dark, spiky hair, possibly a prisoner in a red jumpsuit, is shown fighting another inmate.  The fighting is violent, with blood splatter visible.  Other prisoners in red jumpsuits are fleeing in the background, suggesting a widespread disturbance.  Numbers "21" and "22" are visible on the walls, possibly cell block designations.  A text box indicates that a character hasn't heard news from outside the prison since their arrest in Hosu City.  Another panel shows the same character, seemingly contemplating the dire situation beyond the prison walls, implying Tartarus has fallen.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.  The art style is dark and gritty with a red color scheme.
