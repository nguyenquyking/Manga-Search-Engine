One Piece manga panel depicting a large, blue, humanoid figure, possibly Tiamat, having its trajectory redirected.  A smaller, blonde-haired character sacrifices an arm to change Tiamat's course.  A text box indicates "Tiamat is redirected," along with "New Order." Another character, seemingly a soldier, fires a missile, illustrating the redirection's effect on even small projectiles. The overall scene is dynamic, showcasing a large-scale battle with significant power.
