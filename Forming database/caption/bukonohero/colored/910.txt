My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a classroom scene where several students are gathered around a table.  Izuku Midoriya, along with other students including Shoto Todoroki, Katsuki Bakugo, Tsuyu Asui, Ochaco Uraraka, and Eijiro Kirishima, are present.  Aizawa (Eraserhead) is also shown, addressing the group, expressing concern that the roles of several students (Asu, Uraraka, and Kirishima) will be minor and that their presence may not be entirely voluntary.  Midoriya shows a concerned expression, reacting to Aizawa's statement.  The panel emphasizes the power disparity between the "Big 3" and other students.
