One Piece manga panel depicting a horrific scene.  A young boy experiences a terrifying event, clutching his head in distress.  The same event simultaneously befalls Hana (another character, partially visible).  The panels showcase visceral imagery of a monstrous, shadowy entity, with sound effects like "SKRCH," "HORK," and "KRAK" emphasizing the violent nature of the event.  The narrative text reveals the boy's thoughts and confirms a villain is responsible. The overall tone is dark and suspenseful.
