Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A two-panel manga spread depicting a battle scene. The top panel shows a wounded, light-skinned man with spiky white hair, looking up at a small, dark vehicle flying in a bright blue sky. Text above him reads, "NOT ON YOUR RADAR, HUH, YOU TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP?!"  The lower panel shows Katsuki Bakugo, with spiky blond hair and red eyes, intensely focused as he aims a large, glowing cannon-like device.  Text within the panel states, "HE WAS JUST BAIT!"  A small "KCHK" sound effect is present near the weapon.  The overall scene suggests an ambush or a strategic maneuver during combat.
