Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  **Panel 1:** Close-up of Izuku Midoriya's shocked face, eyes wide, with green energy crackling around him. A speech bubble reads "It's Shigaraki!" indicating his recognition of the villain.  **Panel 2:** Shoto Todoroki uses his ice quirk to create a massive "Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall," depicted as a large wave of ice.  Midoriya and another character (possibly another student) are shown surfing/riding the ice wave.  The sound effect "WHOOSH" is prominently featured.  Small ice shards are scattered around the ice wave.
