A female character with long, light purple hair, identifiable as a powerful fighter, is shown moving at high speed, creating a trail of light and energy. She's attacking several dark, shadowy figures, possibly villains or henchmen.  The scene takes place in a futuristic-looking laboratory or facility with large, cylindrical containers. The text indicates her abilities surpass those of a rabbit. In the lower panel, a close-up of the same female character's menacing, bloodied face shows her taunting an unseen opponent.  The words "You're first, you dumb old fart!" express her aggressive intent.
