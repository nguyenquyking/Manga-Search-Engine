One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A muscular, shirtless man is shown in a smaller inset panel, seemingly exhausted.  Machia, a villain with green skin and a mask, urges Shigaraki, another villain with white hair and bound arms, to act.  A female character with purple hair and teal clothing attacks with energy blasts.  Another female character with light green hair is shown in a separate panel, looking angry.  The overall scene is chaotic, with emphasis on the need for Shigaraki to take action despite his weakened state.
