A group of heroes, including a woman with long blonde hair and horns, stands in a post-explosion industrial area.  A seated, fiery-haired hero is centrally positioned.  Another hero, in a dark cloak, sits nearby.  A blonde-haired hero with goggles and a smug expression is shown in a separate panel, commenting on the critical state of another individual, possibly Nagant. The scene suggests a post-battle assessment, with dialogue referencing the League of Villains and the extent of damage.  The overall tone is serious and tense.
