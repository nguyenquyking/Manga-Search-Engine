A stylized manga panel depicts Tomura Shigaraki, his body scarred and partially obscured by a dark, mask-like appendage.  His long, white hair is disheveled.  He's interacting with a shadowy, vaguely humanoid figure, seemingly connected to him.  Blood is visible on both figures.  Text bubbles reveal Shigaraki's internal monologue about their "symbiotic relationship" and a command to "never let that hatred die."  The overall tone is dark and violent.
