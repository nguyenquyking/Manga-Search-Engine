A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a young Izuku Midoriya walking away from a distraught, seated individual, possibly a villain, clutching a light-brown object.  Thought bubbles reveal Izuku's internal conflict: his understanding that his power should be used for saving, not killing, influenced by All Might, contrasting with the reality of Shigaraki's actions and the harm inflicted on those close to him.  The scene is set against a pale background, emphasizing the emotional distance.  Panels in the background show destruction caused by Shigaraki and other characters, highlighting the context of the emotional struggle.
