My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a fight between two blond characters.  The top panel shows one character, seemingly Hawks (in a damaged state, bleeding), falling backward after being struck by a large, red, curved weapon wielded by the other character, whose face is partially obscured by a mask and blond hair, possibly Endeavor.  The speech bubble above Hawks says "...up-".  The subsequent panels show a close-up of the attack, with the attacker asking "Get it yet?" and a final panel depicting the aftermath with the attacker standing over the fallen opponent. The word "THUD" is prominently displayed to emphasize the impact.  Blood splatters are visible, suggesting a significant injury.
