Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panels:  **Caption:** Tomura Shigaraki's awakening is shown in a dynamic panel.  A powerful, yellowish energy wave emanates from him as the text "AWAKEN, TOMURA SHIGARAKI!" appears.  Another panel depicts a chaotic scene of destruction, possibly a result of Shigaraki's power.  A character (possibly a hero) is seen falling amidst the debris.  A third panel shows a bystander reacting with wide eyes and a pained expression to the loud noise and the intense energy wave, the word "LOUD VOICE!!" is shown in the panel.  The overall scene is one of intense power and destruction.
