A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blond-haired character, possibly a protagonist, is yelling "BROS! Gimme a taste of those lasers!"  He's facing a heavily damaged, bloodied opponent whose head is partially destroyed.  The blond character's attack, labeled "The Lasers...", is shown as a series of bright blue laser beams emanating from a central point.  The scene is dynamic, highlighting the intensity of the combat. The word "ESCHAM" is visible in the background, possibly an onomatopoeia for the impact of the lasers or a shout.
