My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A green-haired hero, possibly Izuku Midoriya (Deku), apologizes to a blond-haired hero wearing a yellow mask, possibly from the "Cleansers," for his mask falling off.  The blonde hero acknowledges the apology.  The scene focuses on the interaction and dialogue between these two, with other characters present but not centrally involved in the main conversation.  The visual elements include speech bubbles containing dialogue, action lines indicating movement ("FWAP"), and close-up expressions on the characters' faces.  The overall mood is one of slightly awkward but ultimately amicable interaction.
