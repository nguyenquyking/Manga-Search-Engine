My analysis of the provided One Piece manga image reveals a scene involving multiple characters.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku), identifiable by his green hair and quirk manifestation, is the central focus. His mouth is forming, allowing him to speak.  He's interacting with a muscular, bald man with sunglasses, who appears to be a supporting character, possibly acting as a confidant or intermediary.  A third character, with white hair and dark clothing, is also present and seems to be addressing Deku.  A fourth, tan-skinned man with sunglasses is also present.  The scene showcases Deku's struggle to control his powers, as evidenced by the partially formed mouth and glowing green energy.  A flashback panel depicts a previous battle where a powerful force overwhelmed Deku's brother.  The overall tone suggests a tense moment of explanation and possibly strategizing.  The speech bubbles indicate discussions concerning privacy and the management of Deku's abilities.
