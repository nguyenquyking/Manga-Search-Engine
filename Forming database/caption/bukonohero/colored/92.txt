A large crowd of My Hero Academia characters, many under umbrellas, are gathered in the rain.  Characters visible include Bakugo, Todoroki, Kirishima, Mina Ashido,  Momo Yaoyorozu, and many other students.  A central figure, possibly Aizawa, stands out, seemingly addressing the group. The scene is somber yet hopeful, reflecting the text bubbles which discuss a grim future and a bright present.  The overall setting is a city street during a downpour.
