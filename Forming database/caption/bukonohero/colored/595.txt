A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A character with spiky dark hair, tears streaming down his face, shouts "NO, YOU'RE IN THE WAY!!"  A speech bubble next to him reads "I STILL NEED TO...". Behind him is a collage of smaller panels showing various smiling My Hero Academia characters, suggesting a flashback or inner vision. Below, a separate action sequence shows a battle between three characters: one with white, spiky hair, another in a yellow and black costume, and a third whose face is obscured.  A bright blue energy trail streaks across the bottom panel.
