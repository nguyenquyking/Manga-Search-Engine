My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation between Himiko Toga and Tsuyu Asui.  Toga, wielding knives,  is seen saying "Thanks for that. Buh-bye," while Asui, surprised, is shown with her tongue extended.  Another panel shows Toga's swift movement, labeled "SWIP".  In the background, a shocked Izuku Midoriya (with a speech bubble saying "Didn't I tell you not to call me that?") observes the scene.  Toga's expression is menacing, and a thought bubble above her head says "Right. Thought so."
