Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A three-panel manga spread depicting a tense confrontation.  The first panel shows a young boy with dark hair and red eyes, stating "I'm okay now, Mom." The second panel shows a chaotic scene with a larger, shadowy figure seemingly confronting a smaller figure amidst rubble.  Text bubbles indicate the larger figure is asking, "Did you sneak into my study?!" and shouting "Tenko!!". A woman with reddish-brown hair is also partially visible, seemingly injured or subdued. The third panel features a close-up of a character with silver hair and red eyes, a sinister grin on their face, possibly Tenko.  The overall style suggests a powerful and dramatic moment in a fight, with a focus on tension and emotional conflict.
