My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Panel 1 shows a female character with large, white hair, observing a blue energy burst, implying a battle. Panel 2 shows a wide shot of a city scene with a helicopter flying away.  Panel 3 shows a concerned expression on a blonde male character's face. Panel 4 shows a group of characters: a blonde male, a pink-haired female, and a male with half-white, half-red hair.  The overall scene suggests a post-battle situation, with the main threat neutralized.  Characters include All Might (blonde male), possibly Bakugo (blonde male in panel 1), and other recognizable My Hero Academia characters. The scene is set in a city.
