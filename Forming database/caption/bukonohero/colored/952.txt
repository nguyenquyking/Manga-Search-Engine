My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion about a drug that erases Quirks.  Red Riot (Tamaki Amajiki) was shot with this drug during his debut battle.  A hero, possibly affiliated with the Eightfold Cleansers (implied to be involved in distributing unlicensed goods), explains the situation.  The Eightfold Cleansers' past actions of destroying similar substances are mentioned.  The visual shows the drug's remnants being crushed by a character who seems to be part of the discussion.
