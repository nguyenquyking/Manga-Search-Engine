Manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A figure resembling a turtle-like humanoid, possibly a mutated individual, asks "You good?"  Another character, Shigaraki, is seen falling down a dark shaft, exclaiming "Ahh!" and "Arghhh!".  A third character, seated in a chair resembling a throne, observes the situation. The overall scene suggests a dark, underground setting with a tense atmosphere.  The visual style is reminiscent of manga artwork, with exaggerated expressions and dynamic action lines.
