A manga panel depicts Toya Todoroki, the eldest son of Endeavor, revealing himself.  He is shown on a television screen and in a subsequent panel, seated, scarred, and stitched, confessing to killing over 30 innocent people. A woman with long white hair is shown reacting to this confession.  The scene includes dialogue boxes detailing Toya's identity and his actions, along with a flashback showing a family dinner.  The overall tone is dark and serious.
