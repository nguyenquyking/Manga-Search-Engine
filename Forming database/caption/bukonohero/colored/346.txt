A manga panel depicting a battle scene. A blonde female character, possibly a hero, is shown fighting a large, dark, tentacled monster.  The hero is emitting a yellow energy or substance.  Other figures, possibly villains, are fleeing in the background. Text indicates four enemies have broken away to attack Shigaraki, and the remaining enemies are becoming increasingly coordinated. The scene suggests a dynamic, intense combat situation with a focus on the blonde hero's struggle against the monster.
