Manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large, monstrous, green-skinned being (possibly a villain) is shown in the left panel, its face partially obscured by a mask-like feature.  Green energy crackles around it. Text indicates it's unconcerned about its situation.  A smaller figure (likely a hero, possibly Izuku Midoriya/Deku) is shown in a separate panel, moving away, seemingly escaping.  The text indicates Deku’s duty as the wielder of “One For All” to protect others, even at the cost of his own safety. In the lower panels, a blond-haired hero (likely All Might) is shown, vowing to protect the smaller figure.  Rain is falling in this part of the scene.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
