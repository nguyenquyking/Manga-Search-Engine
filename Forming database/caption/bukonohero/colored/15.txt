A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts Toga Himiko in various scenes.  The first shows her in her room, a pink-toned space, looking at someone sleeping in bed.  The next panel shows her observing the sleeping person, commenting on their cuteness. Subsequent panels feature a close-up of Toga biting the sleeping person's neck, blood visible, while she comments on their dimples and expresses a desire to be close to them.  A shadowed image of a bird is shown in between, symbolizing her thoughts.  The overall tone is dark and suggestive.
