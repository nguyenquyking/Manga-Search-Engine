Panel 1: A conversation between two characters.  One, with spiky red hair, expresses surprise at hearing about a drug that can nullify Quirks. The other, a large figure in a hooded cloak, explains that such drugs were originally intended to help those with weak Quirks.  Panel 2:  The red-haired character, along with the cloaked character, stand before a cityscape at night.  They discuss the need to examine the red-haired character at the hospital, and then return to the office.  Panel 3: Close-up of the red-haired character, Eijiro Kirishima, who appears to be slightly concerned, possibly reacting to the news from the previous panels.  The panel also shows part of a building in the background.
