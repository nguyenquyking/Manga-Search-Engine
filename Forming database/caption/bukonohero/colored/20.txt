A manga panel depicting Twice (holding a vial of his own blood) surrounded by his clones. Text explains that consuming someone's blood allows the user to temporarily acquire their Quirk.  Another panel shows a character (possibly Tomura Shigaraki) who plans to use Twice's blood to keep his army marching.  The overall scene is dark and ominous, highlighting the strategic use of Twice's Quirk and the grim determination of his allies.
