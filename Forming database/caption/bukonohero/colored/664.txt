My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Two dark-feathered, bird-like villains, one larger than the other, are shown engaging in combat. One villain is subduing a blond-haired student, seemingly causing significant injury.  A second student, with dark hair and teal eyes, observes from a distance, commenting on the situation and expressing concern. The panels show a sense of urgency and danger, with damage to the surrounding environment and the injured student's pained expression. The larger villain's attack has caused widespread destruction.  The smaller villain seems to be concerned about the state of the injured student.  The scene suggests a conflict between villains and U.A. High School students.
