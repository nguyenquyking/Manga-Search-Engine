Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A two-panel manga spread depicting an intense confrontation.  The top panel shows a dynamic action scene where Shigaraki grabs an opponent (likely Izuku Midoriya, given the green hair and costume), with electrical effects and motion lines emphasizing the struggle. The bottom panel shows a close-up of two characters facing off: a scarred, white-haired character (likely a villain) vowing not to forgive anyone, and a determined character (likely Midoriya) with bright, determined eyes, declaring he will never forgive his opponent.  The overall mood is one of high tension and conflict.
