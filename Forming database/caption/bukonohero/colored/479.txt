A four-panel manga comic depicts a scene of societal unrest and a character's rebellion. Panel one shows a crowd of people, seemingly civilians, with a man in a white shirt stating, "You've got the common trash, all too dependent on being protected." Panel two showcases a powerful, armored female figure amidst chaos and destruction, with text indicating a "corrupt, vicious cycle" created by "brave guardians."  Panel three presents a wide cityscape, with the character narrating, "This whole system you've built has always rejected me."  The final panel shows a close-up of a determined Izuku Midoriya (presumably), eyes glowing green, alongside another character with white hair.  Midoriya declares, "Simple enough, yeah?"  The other character explains, "That's why I took this power for myself. That's why I destroy," and Midoriya concludes, "Now I'm ready to reject it."  The overall scene suggests a revolution against an established system.
