Here's a detailed caption for the provided manga image:  A four-panel manga sequence depicting a tense scene.  Panel one shows a blonde woman with spiky hair, expressing frustration ("Serious suckage, yo."), reacting to a situation. Panel two shows a dark-haired man and a blonde woman walking down a city street, with rubble visible, while the man expresses regret about a missed opportunity ("One little hit..."). Panel three shows a close-up of a blonde woman on a phone, receiving urgent information ("You two gotta run!"), and a man in the background. Panel four shows the blonde woman still on the phone, concerned about the situation and the time ("How long're the cell towers even gonna last?") as another person communicates to her via cellphone ("Psst. Call from Makabe.")  The overall scene suggests a crisis situation, possibly involving the destruction of cell towers.  The visual style is action-oriented, dark toned, utilizing speech bubbles and onomatopoeia for effect.
