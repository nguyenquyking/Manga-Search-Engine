A manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A man with silver hair and a dark purple coat, identified as "The Gentle Criminal," is the central figure. He's mid-action, creating a swirling effect around him.  Two smaller female characters with red hair, appearing to be his accomplices, are shown expressing distress, one holding a camera.  They are in what they describe as their "usual predicament." The Gentle Criminal speaks directly to the reader, while the smaller characters discuss their foiled plans. Another scene shows two young male characters, possibly students, being observed by the Gentle Criminal and his associates, who are trying to enter "U.A." The overall scene is dynamic and suggests a heist or infiltration attempt in progress.
