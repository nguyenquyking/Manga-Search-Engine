One Piece Manga panel depicting a scene with several characters. A young boy, Toya, is shown with burns, being comforted by an adult.  Another scene shows Toya's family, including Natsuo and Fuyumi.  A third scene shows a stern-looking adult, possibly a mentor figure, advising Toya to look beyond his current situation and make friends. The dialogue emphasizes the contrast between Toya's focus on heroism and the normalcy of a childhood with friends.  The visual style is consistent with One Piece's manga art.
