One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a severely injured character, possibly a son, lies on a couch, his body heavily scarred and stitched.  He states, "Can't feel a thing, though."  In another panel, a large, burning building is visible in the distance, with a hand, possibly belonging to the injured character, reaching towards it.  Text bubbles indicate a conversation where the speaker expresses concern for the burning building ("That's a lotta burning...") and the injured character's father's resilience ("I know dear old dad ain't gonna die"). The injured character's father's position in society is also mentioned, suggesting his death would require a public statement ("He'll have to make some kinda public statement pretty soon too"). The overall tone is somber and dramatic, highlighting injury, loss, and the ramifications of power.
