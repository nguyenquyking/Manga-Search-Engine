Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A dynamic action scene depicts Lady Nagant, a character with blue hair, being impaled by a large, glowing blade.  Blood splatters are visible. The attacker, seemingly Izuku Midoryia (though not explicitly named), is shown mid-strike from above. Text boxes indicate Nagant's gun is broken and the fight is over.  The scene is set against a nighttime cityscape. The text "Faux 100 Percent: Manchester!" is prominently displayed, suggesting a powerful attack name or technique.  A smaller panel shows Lady Nagant's damaged state.
