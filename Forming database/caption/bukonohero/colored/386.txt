A colored manga panel depicts a dramatic scene featuring several characters.  A towering figure, possibly Starservant, with white hair and dark clothing, dominates the upper panels.  His expression is intense, and he appears to be in motion.  Two characters with red hair, possibly Todoroki, are shown reacting in close-up panels, displaying expressions of emotional turmoil and possibly relief.  Another character, with a bloody face, is partially visible, suggesting a recent conflict.  The dialogue bubbles reveal internal conflicts and discussions about family, praise, and the weight of responsibility.  The overall mood is intense and emotionally charged, focusing on internal struggles and resolution.
