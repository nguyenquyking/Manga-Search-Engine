Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga image suitable for vector embedding:  A blond-haired character, possibly injured, is cradled by a dark-purple, winged character.  The blond character appears to be in distress.  A large shard of ice is visible in the background, suggesting a recent ice attack.  A separate panel shows another character, possibly the attacker, launching an ice attack. Text bubbles indicate the characters' reactions and a discussion about starting an action "early".  The style is reminiscent of a manga comic, with speed lines and impact sounds.
