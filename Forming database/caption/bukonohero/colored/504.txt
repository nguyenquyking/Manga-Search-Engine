Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A giant, blue hand crushes a battlefield.  Two figures, possibly  Koala (wearing a leopard-print top) and another character, are being impacted by the force, thrown through the air amidst a shower of debris. In separate panels, a close-up of a shocked, light-haired woman (possibly Koala again) and a monstrous, crystalline-faced antagonist are shown. The scene depicts intense battle and overwhelming power.  The overall color palette is cool-toned, with blues and purples dominating.
