One Piece manga panel depicting a sorrowful scene. A distraught father, his face etched with grief and tear-streaked, expresses his wish for his son to live a joyful life.  The son, shown in separate panels, is visibly distressed and crying out "Father...", overwhelmed by emotion.  In the background, fragmented panels suggest a traumatic event, possibly a fire or explosion, with debris and a pair of glasses visible amongst the wreckage. The overall tone is dark and somber, highlighting the emotional weight of the moment.
