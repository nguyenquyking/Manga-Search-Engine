A tense manga panel depicting a battle.  A powerful, white-haired antagonist, possibly the "Eraser Head," is attacked by several students.  The Eraser Head, showing determination despite injury, states his inability to die before the students graduate.  Another panel shows the Eraser Head preparing to fight, determined to protect his students.  The students are visibly struggling, and the final panel implies the consequences of the Eraser Head's death.  The overall tone is serious and action-packed.
