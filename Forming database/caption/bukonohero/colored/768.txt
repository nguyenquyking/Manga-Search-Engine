A powerful, red-skinned, muscular figure, possibly a villain, breaches a secret passage, causing a large-scale destruction. The impact is depicted with onomatopoeia "KRASH" and "ZABWAM".  Bystanders are shown in the background witnessing the event.  A dark-haired, possibly heroic character, is seen reacting to the destruction with the text "HUH?! OUR SECRET PASSAGE!!".  Further panels show close-ups of the destruction, purple energy blasts, and the hero's action, including onomatopoeia "SHWOOP", "RMMMMBLL", and "SNAP" indicating the force and speed of the events.  The hero appears to be using a quirk or ability that involves purple energy. The style suggests it's from a manga or comic book.
