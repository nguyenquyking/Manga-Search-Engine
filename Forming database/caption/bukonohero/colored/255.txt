A highly stylized comic panel depicting Bakugou Katsuki's enraged face, mouth slightly open, blood splattered near his face, showcasing intense anger and distress.  He is shouting "DAMMIT, FREAKIN' DEKU!!"  A separate panel shows Deku (Izuku Midoriya) seemingly injured and lying in a hospital bed, observed by Todoroki Shoto and another character.  A speech bubble above Deku asks "DEKU?". The scene suggests a critical situation, possibly after a battle, with Bakugou's powerful emotion the central focus. The art style is reminiscent of manga, employing exaggerated expressions and dynamic linework.
