Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A dramatic scene unfolds in a dark, urban setting.  A severely injured individual, possibly Shigaraki, lies on the ground,  while another character, possibly a villain, confronts a figure who insists on delivering a container of "stored data" to the "right people."  The scene is punctuated by explosions ("Kaboom," "Krash") and the mention of Chizome Akaguro.  The dialogue suggests a conflict over the data's possession and its importance.  The overall mood is tense and action-packed.
