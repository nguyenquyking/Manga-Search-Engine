Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A dynamic manga scene depicts a fierce battle.  A red-haired character with a muscular build, possibly Bakugo, is shown in mid-air, launching an attack.  A blond character, possibly Kirishima, initially lies defeated but later escapes, expressing both relief and self-criticism ("Damn, I'm an idiot!!").  The blond character is rescued, showing his trust.  The background shows an urban setting with a metallic structure.  Speed lines and impact effects emphasize the intensity of the fight.  The blond character's dialogue expresses his determination to escape and his naive trust.  The overall mood is one of high-stakes action and near-miss escape.
