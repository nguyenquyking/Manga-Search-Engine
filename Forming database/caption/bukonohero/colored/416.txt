A manga panel depicting Himiko Toga, partially nude and covered in a transforming, light-grey liquid substance, running down a narrow alleyway.  She looks surprised and says, "You will?!"  In the foreground, Himiko's surprised face is partially visible behind a larger, obscured figure, possibly another character. This figure reacts with shock, saying "...Toga?!"  The setting is a dimly lit alley with a small potted plant visible. The overall mood is tense and suspenseful.
