Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  Multiple panels depict a dynamic fight scene.  Tomura Shigaraki uses his Decay Quirk, his massive hands engulfing a light-blue haired character (likely Tamaki Amajiki).  Another panel shows Shigaraki's face, scarred and masked.  A separate panel shows a character (possibly Kurogiri) being attacked, with the onomatopoeia "RUB RUB RUB" indicating friction.  Another character (possibly Amajiki) is shown dashing, with the word "DASH" prominently displayed.  The word "SHIELD" appears in a panel showing a character attempting to block an attack. The overall scene is chaotic and action-packed, highlighting the use of Quirks in combat.
