The first panel shows a cityscape in ruins, implying a destructive event. Subsequent panels show a young character at a computer, reflecting on their rejection and feeling like a failed creation.  The final panel features a close-up of a character, possibly Shoto Todoroki, contemplating the statement that "These murderous flames of mine are Endeavor's flames," revealing a complex family history and the burden of legacy. The text bubbles detail a forced marriage to create stronger quirks and subsequent rejection.
