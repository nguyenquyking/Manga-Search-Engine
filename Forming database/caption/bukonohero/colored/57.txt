A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Tomura Shigaraki and another character, possibly All Might, contemplating the nature of Ms. Star's new rule.  Shigaraki is shown with a disturbed expression, questioning his own identity and the effectiveness of Ms. Star's rule. The other character is shown in thought, considering Shigaraki's breathing difficulties and the need to circumvent attacks. Text boxes discuss the rule's application to living and non-living targets, and the impact of self-awareness on the rule's efficacy.  The visual style is dynamic, with contrasting color palettes highlighting the characters' expressions and internal conflicts.
