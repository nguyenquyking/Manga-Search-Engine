Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A monstrous, seemingly aquatic creature is depicted in the foreground, its mouth agape in a roar ("BWAAHH!"), with debris scattering around it.  The creature's expression is one of pain or exertion ("AHH!").  In the background, numerous dark, sharp projectiles are shown impacting the scene with sound effects suggesting impact ("SHNK", "BWF").  A speech bubble in the lower left corner observes that these antagonists have undergone significant upgrades since the Jaku incident.  The overall scene depicts a fierce battle.
