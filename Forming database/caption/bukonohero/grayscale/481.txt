My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense scene outside UA High.  An angry crowd, including a man with glasses shouting "Don't let that boy take one step...", prevents a young boy (possibly Izuku Midoriya) from entering the school.  Another panel shows a wide shot of a large crowd under umbrellas, with a smaller group in the foreground, possibly representing the boy's approach.  A third panel shows a person with a megaphone trying to calm the crowd, while text indicates that Shigaraki was targeting a child.  The overall atmosphere is one of chaos and anticipation.
