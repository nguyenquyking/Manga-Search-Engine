My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large, shadowy figure, possibly All For One, with spiky hair amidst a rain-swept, ruined cityscape.  A smaller figure, possibly a subordinate, is bowing before them.  The scene suggests a looming power struggle and the rise of a powerful antagonist. Speech bubbles indicate the impending "Void Era" and the antagonist's ambition to become the "greatest demon lord."
