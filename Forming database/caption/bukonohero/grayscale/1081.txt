My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Top panel shows a muscular, blond character (likely a villain) being attacked by a dark-haired character (possibly All Might or a similar powerful hero) who unleashes a powerful energy blast. The blond character is severely injured. The middle panels show a close-up of Katsuki Bakugo, his face contorted in exertion and anger, and a speech bubble asks, "You want us to help with his training?". The bottom panel shows a wide shot of a city landscape with bare trees, suggesting a winter setting.  The word "WHOOSH" is present, emphasizing the movement of the energy blast.
