My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where a character, possibly All Might, is seen departing rapidly, leaving another character concerned.  The departing character apologizes for having to leave abruptly. The remaining character expresses worry about the departing character's safety and the potential danger to others.  Strategic discussions about the best course of action are shown in thought bubbles, focusing on the importance of proactively engaging the enemy and keeping the departing character isolated for strategic advantage.  The art style is consistent with My Hero Academia's signature dynamic action and speech bubble presentation.
