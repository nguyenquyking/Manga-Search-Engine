My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A frightened, crying girl with fish-like features (likely Nejire Hado) pleads for attackers to stop.  Several villains, including one wielding a large weapon resembling a gun, are attacking her and others.  One villain is particularly prominent, and he seems to be strategizing, intending to exploit a moment of lowered guard.  The scene is set outdoors in the rain, with an umbrella visible in the background.  The overall mood is one of intense action and danger.
