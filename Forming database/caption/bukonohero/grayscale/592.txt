My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  A masked individual, possibly Tomura Shigaraki, dominates the central panels, his expression intense.  He is shown speaking, referencing a woman's actions as being of her own free will and contrasting this with the fate of others labelled "villains."  A smaller panel shows a group of smaller, less-defined figures, possibly Shigaraki's associates.  Another panel shows a man in a suit, possibly a villain, with hands clasped.  The scene is set in a deserted location. The overall mood is serious and contemplative.
