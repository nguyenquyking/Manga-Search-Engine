My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A partially obscured character, possibly a villain,  is seen emerging from rubble.  Another character, possibly Akaguro, questions if he is "a man" or "a beast."  A third character, whose dialogue suggests he is an ally to the world, observes the scene, stating he is a beast despite being an ally. The overall tone is dramatic and ominous, suggesting a conflict between opposing forces.
