My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Tomura Shigaraki walking away from a building after a confrontation.  Three figures, presumably villains, are shown exiting a building in the background.  A speech bubble indicates Shigaraki's thoughts about All For One and his own capabilities, and his determination to steal One For All.  The overall scene is dark and dramatic.
