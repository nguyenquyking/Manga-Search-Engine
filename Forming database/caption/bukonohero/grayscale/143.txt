My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large-scale battle.  Multiple figures, possibly villains, are shown being slammed into the ground by large, dark, geometric structures resembling cages.  Bakugou Katsuki is visible in the upper left, seemingly reacting to the scene with a shocked expression.  The text "CAGES?" and "THEY CAN'T BE SERIOUS." express his disbelief.  The overall scene is chaotic and destructive, featuring impact sounds ("BAM," "DOOM") and dynamic lines indicating force. The scene suggests a large-scale capture or containment operation.
