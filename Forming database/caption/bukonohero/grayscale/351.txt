Here's a concise caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  Tomura Shigaraki is shown in action, using his Quirk.  A narrative panel depicts a past event where a young child witnesses a crime and is saved by someone.  The child later becomes inspired by a hero (possibly All Might, implied by the text). The panels contrast the present violent action with a flashback revealing the character's motivation and past trauma.  The scene involves a car, a burglar, and a family.
