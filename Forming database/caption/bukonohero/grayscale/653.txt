Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panels:  **Panel 1:** A masked villain, possibly a Nomu, lunges forward, declaring their intention to confront a female opponent.  The villain's attack is dynamic, depicted with motion lines.  **Panel 2:**  A female character with short, spiky hair deflects the villain's attack with apparent ease, commenting on the ease with which she blocked multiple attacks.  **Panel 3:**  Two male characters are shown in the rain. One appears concerned and is rushing towards a location, the other is sitting defeated on the ground.  The speech bubble indicates the urgency to reach "the boss."  Another female character, possibly a different villain or hero, is also present.
