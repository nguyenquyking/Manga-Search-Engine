My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Shigaraki Tomura, engulfed in a destructive, white, flame-like energy labeled "frenzied flame of death," is shown overpowering an opponent (partially visible, possibly another villain). Shigaraki's expression is one of intense aggression, his face contorted. The text indicates even the "Demon Lord" had to abandon this level of power. The scene emphasizes the overwhelming force of Shigaraki's attack.
