Here's a caption describing the My Hero Academia manga panel:  A close-up of a woman with long blonde hair, possibly Lady Nagant, is shown alongside a panel of Shigaraki Tomura.  Text bubbles reveal Nagant's conviction that All Might's presence is overwhelming, referencing his "8 long strands" and stating that if Shigaraki were to move, All Might's "heart will stop."  The panels convey a tense atmosphere and a power dynamic related to All Might's influence and Shigaraki's threat.
