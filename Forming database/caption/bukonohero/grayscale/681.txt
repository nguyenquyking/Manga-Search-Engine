My Hero Academia manga panel depicting the aftermath of a major escape. Shigaraki, Dabi, and All For One are mentioned as escaped convicts.  The authorities lack the manpower to effectively pursue them, hampered by the sheer scale of the escape and the strength of the escaped villains, including Shigaraki, who proved too powerful even with Endeavor and Aizawa's help.  The scene highlights the overwhelming nature of the situation, with Nomu also mentioned as part of the escape. The panel also shows a character (possibly Izuku Midoriya) reacting to the news, highlighting the gravity of the situation.
