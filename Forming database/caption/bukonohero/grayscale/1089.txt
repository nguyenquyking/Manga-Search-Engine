My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between Katsuki Bakugo and a masked Endeavor.  Bakugo, looking pensive, holds a drink.  Endeavor, partially obscured by shadow, sits nearby. The dialogue focuses on Endeavor's change and Bakugo's limited ability to comment.  A previous panel shows a younger character, possibly Izuku Midoriya,  understanding the concept of precision over power.
