My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  A phone displays missed calls and messages from Shoto.  Another panel shows a man (possibly Endeavor) apologizing to Shoto, who is seen in a separate panel seemingly in distress, urging someone to stop Toya.  Midoriya is shown reacting to encountering a "second hired gun," receiving a message from All Might.  A man, possibly another pro hero, is also shown receiving a message, suggesting a coordinated effort. The overall scene is tense and action-oriented, focusing on communication and urgent events.
