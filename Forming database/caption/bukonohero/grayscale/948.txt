Another panel shows a hero, possibly Hawks, fighting Nomu, highlighting the power disparity and emphasizing Eri's training.  The overall scene illustrates Eri's emotional state and the context of her training. Characters present include Eri, a hero with dark hair (possibly Tomura Shigaraki), and possibly Hawks.
