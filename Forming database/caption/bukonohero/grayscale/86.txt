My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Toga Himiko.  The top panel shows a close-up of Toga's face, a smirk visible. The middle panel shows her using her quirk, creating a wave of ice to attack an unseen opponent. Speech bubbles reveal Toga's frustration:  "Act like a normal little girl!!" and "Why can't you just be normal?!" The bottom panels show a smaller Toga smiling mischievously and a scene of her seemingly amongst a group of captured individuals.  The overall mood is aggressive and highlights Toga's struggle with her identity and actions.
