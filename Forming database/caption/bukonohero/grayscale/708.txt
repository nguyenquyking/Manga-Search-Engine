My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a intense battle scene.  A large, muscular, blond character with a severely damaged eye is shown in close-up, reflecting on a past event.  Text bubbles reveal this is a pivotal moment ("point of no return"). Another panel shows a smaller character, possibly a hero, mid-air, implying an attack. A subsequent panel shows a large impact,  the blond character is forcefully slammed into the ground,  undergoing a powerful attack denoted by large "BAM" sound effect. The smaller character's attack is implied to be insufficient ("He didn't jump high enough"). The overall scene showcases high-impact action and a significant turning point in the fight.
