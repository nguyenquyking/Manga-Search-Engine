My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense rescue scene.  Shoto Todoroki is shown bracing himself, preparing to enhance his armor.  Simultaneously, a distressed  Bakugo is seen, shouting "Yo! No!!" in protest or alarm.  Another character, possibly a pro-hero, is shown rushing towards a distressed child (off-panel) yelling "Let's save that kid!!".  The overall scene suggests an urgent situation requiring immediate intervention.
