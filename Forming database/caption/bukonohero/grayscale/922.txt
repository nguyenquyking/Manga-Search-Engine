My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Hawks (with large feathered wings), is shown falling or being thrown into the ground amidst a powerful explosion or energy wave. Other characters, including what appears to be Tomura Shigaraki, are shown engaged in combat in separate panels, suggesting a wider conflict.  The text emphasizes the importance of heart and finding allies. The visual style is characteristic of My Hero Academia's dynamic action sequences with heavy use of motion lines and impact effects.
