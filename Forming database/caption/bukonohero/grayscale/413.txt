My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a distant statue and two figures engaged in sword combat amidst large rocks.  The second panel shows a close-up of a scowling face (possibly Tomura Shigaraki) reacting to the scene.  The third shows a conversation between Endeavor and another character (possibly Hawks) discussing a "warm embrace" and bloodlust.  The final panels show a small character placing a sign reading "I AM NOT HERE" onto a statue of All Might, while another character observes. The scene is rainy.
