My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation in the rain.  A female assassin, wielding a large, energy-based weapon with purple energy streaks, commands "Follow my orders and..."  She states she'll leave her target's limbs attached.  The target, partially visible, appears to be a male in an orange outfit, seemingly cowering.  Text on the panel states "An assassin... sent by all for one!" suggesting the assassin is part of a larger group. The scene is dark and ominous, highlighted by rain and the weapon's glowing energy.
