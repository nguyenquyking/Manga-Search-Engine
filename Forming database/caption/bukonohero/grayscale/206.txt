A chaotic scene in a damaged U.A. High School R&D facility for the U.A. barrier.  Izuku Midoriya and another character (possibly a classmate) observe the destruction.  The facility is strewn with debris and damaged equipment.  Several other figures, possibly students or staff, are visible in the background amidst the wreckage.  Midoriya states he is in charge of R&D for the U.A. barrier, and comments on the state of disrepair.  The overall visual impression is one of significant damage and disarray following an apparent attack or accident.
