My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A villain, wielding a katana, stands menacingly above a partially obscured, masked figure, possibly a hero. The villain's expression is fierce, and a speech bubble above him reads, "What vile blasphemy against a great hero."  The scene is dark and dramatic, rain implied by background shading. The visual focus is on the weapon and the characters' contrasting postures.
