My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  A blonde-haired man, possibly a past hero, states he died of old age, contrasting his life with that of Shinomori, a reclusive hero shunned by modern society. The scene shows flashbacks of Shinomori engaging in action sequences, possibly during his time as a hero.  Another character, possibly a younger hero, comments on Shinomori's death at age 40, questioning the cause.  All Might's notes are referenced, suggesting they contain information about Shinomori's death, but some details are missing.
