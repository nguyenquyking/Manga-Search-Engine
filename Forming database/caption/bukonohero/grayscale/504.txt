My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  Midoriya (Deku) uses his quirk, launching himself at high speed ("Zoom").  Uraka uses her quirk, creating a large explosion ("BWOOM") seemingly impacting a villain.  Another character, possibly Bakugo, is shown reacting.  The panels showcase fast-paced action and significant force impact from the combined quirks.
