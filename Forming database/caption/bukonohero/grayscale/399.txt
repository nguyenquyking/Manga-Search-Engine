My Hero Academia manga panel depicting several characters interacting.  Jiro Kyoka and Momo Yaoyorozu are shown reacting to Denki Kaminari's boisterous behavior.  The panel then shifts to a discussion between Yaoyorozu, Kaminari, Shoto Todoroki, and a smaller panel featuring Jirou and another character (possibly a teacher).  The final panel shows the group together, including Eijiro Kirishima and Katsuki Bakugo, seemingly planning something.  The overall tone suggests a lighthearted yet strategic moment within the narrative.
