A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Tomura Shigaraki, in his decayed form, stands amidst rubble, a large, dark figure.  He's positioned above a fallen, seemingly defeated, villain with a shark-like mask and patterned clothing.  The fallen villain is impaled by a dark, spiky appendage extending from Shigaraki.  Another, smaller figure is visible in the background, observing the scene. The text bubble reads "It's already... ...over." The overall setting is a damaged building interior with a staircase.
