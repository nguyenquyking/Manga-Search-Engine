My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a high-speed chase.  A character, possibly a villain, is propelled through the air using what appears to be a jet-like device, leaving a trail of smoke and speed lines.  Another character, with short, reddish-brown hair, observes this from below, stating, "You got some nerve!" and later, "Hide in the smoke all you like... you won't get away."  The scene is dynamic and suggests a confrontation between the two characters.  The visual style emphasizes motion and impact.
