My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between a man and a woman in a Japanese garden setting. The woman, with short, light-colored hair, is described as "strong... but prone to melting away at the slightest touch". The man, with dark hair and a serious expression, comments that the flowers are "so pretty" and asks if she likes them.  A previous panel shows the man and woman, along with another woman, in a different location. Text indicates the woman's marriage was a "quirk marriage" for her family's sake. The overall mood is contemplative and slightly melancholic.
