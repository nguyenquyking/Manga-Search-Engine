My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Shoto Todoroki's reflection.  He expresses gratitude ("Thank You!") after a powerful energy exertion, possibly relating to his fire and ice powers.  He reflects on feeling behind others ("everyone else had gotten so far ahead") but acknowledges reclaiming aspects of his past ("I've reclaimed so much for myself").  The scene shows Todoroki walking away from a bright light, symbolizing moving forward.  The panels include dialogue suggesting apologies and the release of pent-up energy.  Visuals include a close-up of Todoroki’s face, a wide shot depicting his progression, and a symbolic representation of the past.
