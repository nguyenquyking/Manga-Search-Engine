Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A severely injured man, possibly Endeavor (his identity is not explicitly confirmed but highly suggested by his appearance and context), wearing a medical mask and bandages, cries, saying "Yes!!" in response to an off-panel instruction.  In a separate panel, a young man (possibly Shoto Todoroki or a close associate), speaks to another individual (possibly another young man), stating,  "This is only until we stop Toya, got it?". The second young man affirms with a "Yes!!".  The final panel shows a group including Shoto Todoroki and other characters, suggesting a tense situation, likely relating to Toya's actions. The overall scene depicts a serious moment of agreement amidst a critical situation.
