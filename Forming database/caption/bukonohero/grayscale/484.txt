My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Shoto Todoroki, Katsuki Bakugo, and Izuku Midoriya standing before Endeavor's agency.  A large, fiery figure, presumably Endeavor in his hero costume, looms in the foreground, threatening to test them.  Three men in suits and sunglasses are visible behind the fiery figure. The scene takes place shortly before the events of the *World Heroes' Mission* film.
