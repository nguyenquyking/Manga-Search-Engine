My Hero Academia manga panel depicting the final escape of Mr. Compress.  The panel shows Compress, bloodied but smiling, having seemingly successfully used his Quirk to create a distraction.  In the background, a fast-paced action sequence shows him using his Quirk,  "Compression," to escape with other characters (likely villains).  The text indicates this is the final scene of his escape.  The scene is dynamic with motion lines indicating speed and power.
