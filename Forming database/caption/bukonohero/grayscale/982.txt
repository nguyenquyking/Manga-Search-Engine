My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where a young man with spiky hair vehemently disagrees with something shown on a computer screen.  The screen displays a news report, likely concerning Endeavor.  Another character, possibly a news reporter, is shown in the background.  The young man's disbelief is emphasized by his expression and the text "We're not that freakin' stupid!!"  The scene then shifts to show Hawks, the Number Two Hero, being apprehended or restrained.  The text implies a call for Hawks' intervention. The overall tone is one of intense disbelief and urgency.
