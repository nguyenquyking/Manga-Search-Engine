My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a nighttime cityscape.  A woman with long hair sits alone at a table overlooking the city, expressing exhaustion and disillusionment ("I was exhausted," "A phony sham").  In another panel, a conversation occurs between a man with glasses and a woman with pink hair, questioning the morality of killing criminals to improve society ("Is killing them really gonna improve society?").  A third panel shows two individuals in a room, with narration explaining their manipulation of civilians into committing crimes for personal gain ("These two...they've been inciting ordinary civilians to commit crimes before hunting down those freshly minted criminals and collecting the rewards"). The overall tone suggests a critique of vigilante justice and its unintended consequences.
