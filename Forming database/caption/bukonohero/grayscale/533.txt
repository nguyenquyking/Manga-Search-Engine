My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where Katsuki Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, and a masked individual (likely Fumikage Tokoyami) are questioned by a bespectacled man (likely a teacher or authority figure).  Bakugo is shown in the background, gesticulating dramatically, seemingly frustrated.  The other students are seated, appearing concerned or apprehensive. The scene takes place in a large room with multiple students, likely classmates, gathered in a meeting or briefing.  The dialogue suggests uncertainty and a lack of confirmation regarding a key piece of information.
