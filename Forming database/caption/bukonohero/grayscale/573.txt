My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Tomura Shigaraki and Izuku Midoriya are central. Shigaraki, with a distressed expression, boasts of his increased power, matching Midoriya's at 100%.  Midoriya, appearing smaller and vulnerable, is shown in a separate panel, seemingly overwhelmed.  A panel shows a woman, possibly Toga Himiko, reacting, seemingly distressed.  Another panel shows a flashback or parallel scene of a figure (possibly a past version of Midoriya) in a distressed state. The overall tone suggests a critical confrontation with high stakes.
