My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between three characters.  A powerful, older woman with scarred features, possibly Nana Shimura (All Might's grandmother), is centrally positioned.  To her left is a young man with long dark hair, possibly Kotaro's son, expressing intense emotion. To her right is a younger woman with dark hair, possibly observing the interaction. The panel also features a flashback of a man in a suit, possibly representing a past family member with quirk-manipulation abilities. The dialogue reveals familial connections and inherited quirks, with themes of hate and acceptance.
