My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense emotional exchange.  Two figures, seemingly Endeavor and a younger character (possibly his son, Shoto), are shown. Endeavor's hand reaches out, while the younger figure lies collapsed on the ground in the rain.  Speech bubbles convey Endeavor's acknowledgment of the younger character's exhaustion ("You deserve to rest.") and encouragement ("Do your best."), followed by Endeavor's admission of the crushing burden he carries and his need to share this ("I need to... tell you that").  The scene is somber, with rain and a dark sky emphasizing the weight of the situation.
