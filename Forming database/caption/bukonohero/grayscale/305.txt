My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a group of pilots thanking someone (possibly a superior officer), followed by a scene showing a powerful, destructive force (possibly a villain's quirk).  A helmeted individual, possibly a pilot, is shown in distress, facing the destructive force and contemplating a difficult decision regarding pilots and their quirks—whether to forcibly take or distribute their quirks,  indicating a dire situation.  The overall tone is one of urgency and crisis.
