My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A wide shot shows widespread destruction in a parking lot-like area.  Close-ups show several characters:  Aizawa (presumably giving orders), Fatgum taking command,  a distressed character (possibly Monoma) being told to retreat to Aizawa, and a smaller character searching for Aoyama.  The scene emphasizes the chaotic aftermath of a battle, with the enemy seemingly retreating.
