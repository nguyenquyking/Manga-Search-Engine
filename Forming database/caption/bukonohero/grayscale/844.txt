My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense scene.  A young boy, possibly Hawks, with bird-like features, reports feeling tingling sensations and being unseen. An angry adult man, possibly his father, forbids him from leaving the house or talking to anyone.  In another panel, a woman sits amidst scattered papers near a TV, seemingly dejected or unconcerned. The overall mood is one of secrecy and anxiety.
