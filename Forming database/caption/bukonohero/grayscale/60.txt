My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a flashback.  A large, muscular figure wielding staffs is shown amidst a fiery, destructive scene.  A smaller figure is prostrate on the floor.  The narrative text reveals this is a memory of a "failed creation,"  and a "familiar scene" witnessed three years prior.  Framed photographs of a younger Tomura Shigaraki are visible in the background. The overall mood is somber and reflective.
