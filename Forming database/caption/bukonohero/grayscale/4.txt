My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic battlefield scene at the Jaku Hospital ruins, in front of the Gigantomachia containment facility.  Multiple heroes are engaged in combat against a large, dark, amorphous villainous entity.  In the foreground, a triumphant looking Tsuyu Asui (Froppy) comments that Todoroki did his best.  Other heroes including  Ochaco Uraraka (Uravity) are visible in the background, fighting alongside other, less-distinct heroes.  A text box indicates an announcement was made across the battlefield.
