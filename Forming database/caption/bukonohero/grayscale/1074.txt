My Hero Academia manga scene: Bakugo, using his Prominence quirk, unleashes a powerful blast ("BUUURN!!") targeting a fleeing figure.  Another character, possibly Deku, is shown reacting to the attack. The panel suggests a dynamic battle scene with intense energy and motion lines depicting the explosive force.  A close-up shows a partially visible, large, angry face likely belonging to an opponent, reacting to the attack, with dialogue indicating surprise ("You again!").
