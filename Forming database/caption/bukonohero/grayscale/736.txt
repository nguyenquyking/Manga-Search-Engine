A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a severely injured Izuku Midoriya being held by Tomura Shigaraki.  Midoriya is slumped over, seemingly unconscious,  with smoke or energy effects swirling around them.  Shigaraki's "danger sense" was triggered. The lower panel shows a close-up of a sinister, grinning face, possibly hinting at an antagonist's reaction.  The scene is dramatic and suggests a critical moment in the battle.
