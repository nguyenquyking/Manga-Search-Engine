My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a group analyzing radio waves.  A man speculates that someone with a specific quirk could interpret the waves, which contain a conversation decoded from storage media.  A cat-like character reacts with surprise, and another character questions the decoded message's content.  The analysis shows a waveform resembling a conversation, and the urgency of a 38-day deadline is highlighted.  The visual elements include a monitor displaying waveforms, a Nomu (a villain), and text bubbles revealing the characters' thoughts and discussions.
