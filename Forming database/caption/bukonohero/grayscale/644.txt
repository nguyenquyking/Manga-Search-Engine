My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  A character, possibly Nejire Hado, with purple hair, is launching a powerful energy blast, depicted as bright teal and pink electricity, toward an unseen target.  Another character, partially obscured and possibly  in distress, is shown reacting to the attack.  The background suggests an urban setting with rain and destruction.  Text bubbles indicate "I was hiding!!" from the attacker and "That's if..." suggesting an uncertain outcome or a counterattack. The art style is vibrant and energetic, typical of the My Hero Academia manga.
