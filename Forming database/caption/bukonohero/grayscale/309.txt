My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation between All Might (Specter) and a villain.  All Might, in a damaged state, is shown delivering a blow, his face contorted in exertion, while the villain, his face partially obscured, is shown reacting to the attack with a surprised expression.  A speech bubble reads, "Damn you, Specter of All Might!!" The second panel shows a large explosion at sea, possibly caused by All Might's attack, with several dark, bat-like objects and fighter jets in the background. The caption ends with "To be continued!".
