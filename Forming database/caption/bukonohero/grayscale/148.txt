My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya (Deku) and Yuga Aoyama in a parking garage.  Aoyama, looking concerned, holds a phone. Midoriya, appearing slightly anxious, thanks Aoyama for coming.  The scene shows a wide shot of the parking garage and a distant figure standing alone.  Aoyama's question, "Why are you out here, Aoyama?", suggests a clandestine meeting or urgent situation.
