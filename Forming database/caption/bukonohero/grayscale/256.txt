My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation about Yuga Aoyama's quirk.  Aoyama, visibly upset, is shown in several panels.  One panel shows him as a young child standing alone in a large room. Another shows him crying, while three adults, possibly his parents and a doctor, watch from behind him.  A classroom scene shows other children, their faces obscured, participating in a lively activity.  The dialogue reveals that Aoyama was given a quirk to help him fit in, a decision the adults now regret, as it prevented him from pursuing his own dreams.  The visual elements emphasize Aoyama's isolation and the adults' remorse.
