A female character, possibly a villain or anti-hero, with short, light-colored hair, is shown mid-air, aiming a large rifle. She's dressed in dark clothing and boots.  The background depicts a city at night, suggesting an action scene. Text bubbles indicate she's adding something "extra," and that "All for One" would provide such a contractor. A close-up panel shows the rifle firing, with the sound effect "SLAM". The overall scene is dynamic and suggests a moment of attack or ambush.
