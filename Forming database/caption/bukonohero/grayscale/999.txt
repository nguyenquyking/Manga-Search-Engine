My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Shoto Todoroki's backstory.  The scene shows a devastated cityscape, contrasting with panels showing Todoroki as a child, seemingly neglected by his father, Endeavor.  Endeavor's face is shown in a later panel, suggesting his continued observation of Todoroki. The narrative focuses on Endeavor's ambition and Todoroki's creation as a result of that ambition, emphasizing Todoroki's feelings of rejection and his inherited, "murderous" flames.
