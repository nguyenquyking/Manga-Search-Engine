Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A wide-scale destruction scene unfolds in a city as Tomura Shigaraki, heavily damaged and supported by black tendrils, cries out in pain ("AHH!").  In the background, massive destruction is evident.  A narrative box reveals that Machia is praised for superb timing, and that Tomura's body is failing due to injuries sustained from Izuku Midoriya's One For All and Endeavor's flames. Another narrative box explains that Rivet Stab is activated to reduce the burden on Tomura's body and mind.  Machia is ordered to retreat.
