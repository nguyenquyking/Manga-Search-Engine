Here's a caption describing the My Hero Academia manga panel:  A tense battle scene unfolds between Wedge, a masked hero with spiky blond hair, and an unnamed opponent.  Wedge, smugly declaring he shot first, uses a "Reflect Plus Scatter" technique, deflecting an attack and countering with a laser beam, striking his opponent. The opponent reacts with pained expressions.  The scene is dynamic, featuring speed lines and onomatopoeia ("FWOOM," "KWEEEN," "LASER") enhancing the action.
