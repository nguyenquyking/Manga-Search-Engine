My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense scene.  A high-ranking official, possibly a government representative, is escorted by police officers.  He carries a cube-shaped device.  The text indicates his presence "beckons the dark" while his "shining light" is the root cause of a looming demise.  In another panel, Shoto Todoroki, with a serious expression, is shown alongside another character, possibly a classmate or ally, observing a powerful, destructive force in the distance.  The panels suggest a conflict is about to occur.
