My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a hospital scene.  Two heroes, a male and a female, stand in a hallway, expressing concern ("What's... Going on?"). The male hero has short, dark hair and a stern expression, while the female has shorter, dark hair and appears worried.  In another panel, a severely injured individual, possibly Gran Torino, lies in a hospital bed, heavily bandaged and hooked up to medical equipment.  A heart rate monitor displays a reading. Finally, a doctor, possibly Dr. Ujiko, is shown, speaking to someone off-panel, referencing both "Gran Torino" and "Shimura."  The last panel shows a pile of discarded clothing, possibly belonging to Shimura. The overall mood is serious and tense, focused on the injured patient's condition and the characters' reactions.
