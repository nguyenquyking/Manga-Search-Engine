My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple characters and scenes.  All Might, visibly distressed and weakened, comments on his weakened state ("...and his divine soul has turned feeble and mortal").  He instructs another character (possibly a young hero) to utilize information from his time in Tartarus.  A female character, possibly a young hero, expresses concern and support ("I'm doing my best").  A third character, seemingly surprised, questions the observation of a recent event.  The overall scene suggests a critical moment, possibly following a major battle or revelation.
