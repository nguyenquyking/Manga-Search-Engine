A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  Young Izuku Midoriya is shown in the top panel, seemingly injured and surprised, exclaiming "OW?".  The second panel shows a muscular, scarred man looking grim. The third panel shows the same man sitting dejectedly on the ground, near a bridge where two figures, possibly heroes, stand.  Text boxes reveal the man's internal conflict and regret, expressing envy and frustration about Izuku's potential, stating  "You could have been the one..." and reflecting on his own "eternal goal."  The overall mood is melancholic and reflective.
