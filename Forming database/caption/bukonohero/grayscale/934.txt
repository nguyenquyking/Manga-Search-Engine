My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a bound villain, possibly the boss, whose face is largely obscured by shadow and a menacing grin.  The villain is struggling against tight restraints that prevent him from touching the cables necessary to activate his compress quirk.  Text bubbles indicate his frustration and the dire situation. Another character, partially visible, is shown in the background, seemingly observing the villain's predicament.  The overall scene is tense and emphasizes the villain's powerlessness.
