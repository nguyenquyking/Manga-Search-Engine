A manga panel depicting a large hand reaching towards a distressed Earth.  Text boxes describe a hypothetical scenario where a powerful individual, potentially a "demon lord," could control the world through various means (electricity, gas, strength). The world is shown in a state of chaotic decline, lacking potable water. Another text box introduces the possibility of a quirk capable of producing water, presenting an opportunity for a remarkable individual to intervene. The overall scene is dark and ominous, focusing on the power dynamic and potential for change. No specific character names are mentioned.
