Here's a caption for the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  A close-up of All Might's face, severely damaged and crumbling, as he seemingly disintegrates.  Text bubbles indicate his pain ("Curses!", "Quickly, dammit!!") and his resolve ("This is me returning the favor.") A figure in a gas mask, possibly a villain, is shown in the lower right panel, observing All Might's disintegration.  The overall scene depicts All Might's sacrifice or intense struggle.
