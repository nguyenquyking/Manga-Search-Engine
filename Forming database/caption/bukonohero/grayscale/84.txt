My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic ocean scene.  Momo Yaoyorozu, seemingly distressed, stands amidst turbulent water, surrounded by debris and partially submerged figures.  She asks, "What do you wanna do to me?".  A shadowy figure in the background speaks, "Tell me, hero." The scene suggests a confrontation in a harsh, watery environment.  Other characters are present but difficult to identify clearly. The overall visual style is intense and dynamic, emphasizing the power of the water and the uncertainty of the situation.
