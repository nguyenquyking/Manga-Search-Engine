My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where two characters, likely Keigo's siblings, discover their empty home.  One sibling asks "Mom?" while the other wonders if their mother "has fled?".  A third panel shows a character, possibly Keigo, reading a note from their mother explaining that she left due to threats from Dabi's thugs who tracked them down.  The note expresses sorrow and pride in Keigo. The overall mood is one of distress and urgency.
