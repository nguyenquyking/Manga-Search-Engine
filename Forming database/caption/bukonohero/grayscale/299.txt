This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a pivotal moment in Yoichi Shigaraki's past.  A young Yoichi is shown reading "Captain Hero" comics.  The subsequent panels show a severely damaged, older Yoichi, his body decaying as his Quirk is stolen.  He prioritized self-preservation, losing everything in the process.  The narrative emphasizes the consequences of his actions and the incomplete understanding of his Quirk's capabilities at that time.  The scene's visual elements include the contrast between the peaceful image of young Yoichi reading and the chaotic, destructive depiction of his later self, symbolizing the irreversible damage inflicted. The panels also highlight text boxes explaining the mechanics of the "New Order" Quirk and its impact on Yoichi.
