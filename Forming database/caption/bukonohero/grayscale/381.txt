My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All Might and a younger version of himself discussing the One For All quirk.  All Might is shown contemplating the unusual connection he experienced with a boy (implied to be Izuku Midoriya) where he received more than just thoughts, but feelings as well.  The panel shows All Might reflecting on the unique nature of this connection, comparing it to the usual One For All experience and raising questions about the possibility of receiving specific thoughts from Shigaraki's vestige. A cat is also present, possibly representing a symbolic connection.
