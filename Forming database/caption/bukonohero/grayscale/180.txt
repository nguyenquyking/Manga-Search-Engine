My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Toga Himiko.  The top panel shows a visceral, dark image reflecting Toga's internal state, with text bubbles describing a disturbing, self-inflicted transformation. The middle panel shows a close-up of Toga's face, illustrating her contentment with this transformation. The bottom panels show Toga standing in a dilapidated room, labeled "Vampire Demon," after having seemingly discarded something ("threw it all away").  The scene suggests a violent, internal struggle and Toga's embrace of her dark, transformative powers.
