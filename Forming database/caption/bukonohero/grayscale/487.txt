My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a fast-paced battle.  Shoto Todoroki, using ice powers, creates a large ice wave that sweeps across the ground.  Another character, whose name is not visible, is shown reacting to Todoroki's attack, exhibiting impressive reflexes.  A third character, partially visible in the first panel, is seemingly engaged in combat.  The scene is dynamic, featuring speed lines and onomatopoeia (SFX) like "SHNK," "FWOOOM," and "FSSSH," indicating the intensity of the action and the impact of the ice attack. The text "THIS GUY'S GOT REFLEXES FOR DAYS!" highlights the opponent's agility.
