My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  Izuku Midoriya (Midoriya), visibly distressed, is shown alongside a villain whose face is partially obscured by dripping, viscous substance. The villain directly addresses Midoriya, questioning if he can hear him. The narrative recalls past events at USJ and in a forest, implying previous encounters and the villain's manipulation. The villain describes themselves as "a despicable villain," and the final panel shows scattered, cheese-like objects labeled "cheese pieces."  The scene ends with "To be continued!"
