Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  A close-up of Izuku Midoriya, tears streaming down his face, solemnly declares, "We'll bring it all back,"  in response to a panel showing him and his classmates—Katsuki Bakugo, Eijiro Kirishima, Denki Kaminari, and others— standing together in the rain, united despite apparent hardship.  Midoriya's emotional expression and the group's determined posture emphasize their collective resolve.
