My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where Izuku Midoriya stands alone on a rooftop overlooking a rain-swept city at night.  He appears contemplative, his cape billowing slightly. In the previous panels, a masked villain (possibly a Nomu) expresses gratitude to a metallic-faced figure, possibly All for One, who instructs the villain to "eat up". The overall mood is dark and ominous, suggesting a return to a more perilous time.
