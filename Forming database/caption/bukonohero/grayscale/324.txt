My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Star and another character (possibly a Pro Hero in a gas mask) are fighting a severely damaged villain whose face is cracked and regenerating rapidly.  The villain is laughing maniacally while the other character comments on the villain's rapid regeneration and urges Star to use their resources better.  Star is shown attacking the villain, but the attack is seemingly ineffective. The visual elements include speed lines indicating movement and impact, and the villain's damaged and regenerating face is a focal point.
