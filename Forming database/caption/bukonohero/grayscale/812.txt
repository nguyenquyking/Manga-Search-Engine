My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Shoto Todoroki, bandaged and grieving, being urged to action.  Another character, unseen but implied to be a family member, speaks about having talked to Shoto's mother.  Shoto's resolve is strengthened by the reminder that they must all work together to stop Toya.  A subsequent panel shows two other characters, likely friends or allies, in the background, possibly reacting to the situation.  The overall mood is somber yet determined.
