My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a young boy, possibly Deku, wearing a distinctive helmet, reacting with tears and distress.  He witnesses a person, possibly a girl, selecting a pair of red shoes from a shoe store.  A separate panel shows a muscular figure, possibly All Might, walking away, seemingly in a memory or flashback. The boy's emotional response suggests a strong connection to the red shoes and possibly the muscular figure. The scene is set in a shoe store with a price tag visible.
