A young Shoto Todoroki, emotionally charged, trains in a snowy forest.  He demonstrates his fire powers, expressing determination to surpass someone ("him," likely his father).  He is visibly emotional, crying while showcasing his flames, and stating his strength.  The scene emphasizes his resolve and the intensity of his training. The word "Mutter" appears as an onomatopoeia representing his low murmurings.
