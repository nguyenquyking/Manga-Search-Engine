Bakugo and another character (possibly Kirishima) are shown walking away from a large window overlooking a city, discussing the fight against villains and societal forces.  Izuku Midoriya's face is shown in a smaller panel, referencing a secret that prevents societal chaos.  A close-up of Bakugo's determined face is also visible, emphasizing his resolve. The overall tone is one of urgency and clandestine operation.
