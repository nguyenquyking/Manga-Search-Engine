My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large, menacing, red skull-like figure with glowing blue eyes, seemingly disintegrating.  Text bubbles indicate the figure's impending defeat due to the enduring "will of a hero" and the continued willingness of people to help each other. A dark, shadowy figure, possibly a hero, is partially visible below the skull, seemingly confronting or attacking it. The scene is dramatic and apocalyptic, with a focus on the contrast between the decaying villain and the resilient spirit of heroism.
