My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between three characters.  A shadowy figure, possibly a transformed or powerful character, stands centrally.  Two other characters, one in a long coat and tall boots, and another partially obscured, observe. The dialogue boxes reveal discussion about the cause of death and the wielder of "One for All." The scene is intense, with visual effects suggesting power or transformation.
