A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a narrative sequence.  The first panel shows a hooded figure, possibly All For One, stating he possessed One For All for the second longest time after Yagi.  The second panel shows a younger All For One training, explaining he spent 18 years building his power to defeat the previous One For All user.  Subsequent panels show All For One's aging body, with cracks appearing.  He reveals that possessing multiple quirks ultimately killed him, contrary to initial assumptions of an unknown illness or insufficient training.  The final panel suggests that Yagi Toshinori (All Might) uncovered the truth through medical records.
