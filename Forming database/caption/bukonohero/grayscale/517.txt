My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large explosion labeled "LAND MINE BLAST!!"  A character, possibly a villain, is shown partially obscured within the explosion's aftermath.  Katsuki Bakugo is shown in the foreground, smirking, and engaging in a tense dialogue with the unseen character.  Bakugo's dialogue implies he considers the others as insignificant compared to himself now that he's among the powerful. The other character responds, suggesting a dismissive attitude towards further conversation.  The scene is action-packed and highlights the power disparity between Bakugo and his adversaries.
