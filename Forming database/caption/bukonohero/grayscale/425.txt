My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a rainy scene.  Multiple panels show a crowd of people under umbrellas, with text bubbles discussing rumors of a person with multiple quirks, dressed in rags, possibly a villain or a hero.  A subsequent panel shows a close-up of a character (likely a young man) looking distressed, questioning their return to normal life.  Another panel shows two young men; one is asking the distressed young man to rest, and the other is urging them to explain the situation.  The overall scene suggests a period of uncertainty and tension following a significant event.
