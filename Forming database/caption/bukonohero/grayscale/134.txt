My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a strategic discussion among heroes.  The panel shows multiple scenes.  The first shows Aizawa's effective training of Shinso, who's been given special permission to act as a hero despite lacking a license. The second shows a group of heroes discussing the low number of available heroes for an ambush, questioning the feasibility of defeating all enemies.  A third panel shows Eraser Head (Aizawa) contemplating the situation, highlighting a critical point: the need for a surprise attack negates the need for heroes to be present in advance. The final panel focuses on a group of heroes observing a scene from a distance, showing them not in the ambush location as previously discussed.  Key characters include Aizawa, Shinso, and other unnamed heroes.
