My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with All Might and what appears to be a severely injured or decaying version of himself.  All Might is carrying a bag of food, stating he hasn't been eating. He offers food to the other figure, who declines, stating they don't need to tag along anymore and are fine.  The injured figure shows significant physical deterioration. The final panel shows a close-up of All Might's concerned expression. The scene suggests a critical moment of emotional and physical decline for one of the characters.
