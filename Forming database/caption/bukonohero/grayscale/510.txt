My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a high-speed chase.  Deku, airborne and small in the frame, is pursued by a larger, powerfully built character wearing glasses and armored clothing. The larger character, whose name is not explicitly shown but implied to be "Prez," is shouting encouragement to Deku to continue.  The scene highlights the speed differential, with text indicating Deku consistently outpacing the other character.  The visual style emphasizes motion blur and impact lines.
