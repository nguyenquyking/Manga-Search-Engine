A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts Twice, holding a vial of his own blood.  He is surrounded by numerous clones of himself.  Text bubbles reveal his plan to enable his clones to use the quirks of those close to their hearts by drinking their blood.  A separate panel shows a figure, likely Bakugou, and indicates the continued action of the "sad parade." The scene emphasizes Twice's strategic use of his blood and clones.
