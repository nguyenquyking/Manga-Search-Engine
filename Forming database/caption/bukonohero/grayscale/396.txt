My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Panel 1: All Might thanks someone unseen, stating he can catch up to the heights others have reached. Panel 2: Izuku Midoriya and a man (possibly his teacher) discuss protecting those they hold dear. Panel 3: A character (possibly All Might) explains needing to attend to other matters before joining Endeavor's group. Panel 4:  A conversation between Hawks and another character (possibly Aizawa) about Endeavor and other heroes not joining U.A., with Hawks seemingly unconcerned.  The final panel shows the exterior of the U.A. High School Alliance building, where a character is leaving.  The overall theme is about the heroes' actions and decisions in response to a crisis.
