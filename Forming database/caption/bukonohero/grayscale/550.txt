My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Bakugo Katsuki, Uraraka Ochaco, and Iida Tenya.  Bakugo, in a furious expression, is center frame. Uraraka and Iida are beside him, appearing determined.  Speech bubbles indicate Uraraka and Iida's resolve to confront Bakugo, despite knowing his stubbornness, calling him an "All Might wannabe."
