My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a serious conversation between two characters.  Aoyama, visibly distressed, expresses his desire to escape, seeking a secluded place to die.  A second character, possibly a mentor or superior, confronts Aoyama, stating he must confront his inner fear through action ("You will fight").  The conversation touches upon Aoyama's friends' tendency to sugarcoat things and the consequences of his actions, hinting at future repercussions even after the war ends, including the potential loss of his home at U.A. High. The visual style is dark and dramatic, emphasizing the emotional weight of the scene.
