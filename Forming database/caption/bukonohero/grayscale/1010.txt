My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Toga Himiko's actions and narration.  The top panel shows Toga's face, eyes wide, narrating her plan to drop someone from a great height. The subsequent panels show a dynamic action sequence where Toga, using Ochaco Uraraka's Quirk (obtained by drinking her blood), attacks another character (possibly a hero). The final panel is a close-up of Toga's face, expressing happiness about acquiring the Quirk.  The scene is characterized by speed lines and impact words ("WHOA!", "BOOF", "SHUP", "KRASH"), highlighting the intensity of the fight.  Toga's transformation and use of stolen Quirks is a central theme.
