My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A severely injured, light-haired character (possibly Mirio Togata) is shown lying on the ground, his endurance boost seemingly having exceeded its limits. He acknowledges his own folly, stating "I have to agree there!!"  Another character, partially obscured, is shown in the upper right corner, seemingly having taken a hit to protect the first.  The scene is dynamic, with speed lines indicating impact and energy release.  The dialogue highlights the sacrifice made and the consequences of overexertion.
