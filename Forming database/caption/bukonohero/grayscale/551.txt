My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, dark, monstrous figure, possibly a villain or Nomu, is shown in the first panel, possibly emitting energy. The second panel shows the same figure interacting with several smaller figures, possibly heroes, enveloped in white, fiery-like energy. Text indicates concern for the heroes' injuries. The third panel shows a large wave of energy, possibly a powerful attack, launched from the monstrous figure.  The text suggests the scene involves a ninth hero whose wounds are not yet healed.
