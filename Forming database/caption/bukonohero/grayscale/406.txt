My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All Might (wearing a sign saying "I AM NOT HERE") interacting with a younger, distraught All Might (likely a flashback or vision).  The younger All Might expresses regret for not helping his disciple.  A third character, possibly a student or colleague, observes from a distance, and All Might's statement is contrasted by the words "You can live, you can be here" suggesting a message of hope or resilience.  The scene is rainy and somber, emphasizing the emotional weight of the interaction.  A panel shows the younger All Might walking away, possibly signifying acceptance or moving forward.
