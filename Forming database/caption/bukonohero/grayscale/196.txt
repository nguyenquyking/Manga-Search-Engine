My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where a bound Yuga Aoyama is observed through a glass partition.  A young student, possibly from UA High, sits nearby, expressing doubt but ultimately trusting Aoyama's teacher.  Shota Aizawa is shown in a separate panel, implying his involvement.  The overall mood is tense and serious.
