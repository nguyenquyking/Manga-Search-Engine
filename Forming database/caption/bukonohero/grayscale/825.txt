My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters and dialogue boxes.  A severely burned young boy, Toya, is comforted by a man, possibly his father, who urges him to make friends and move beyond his trauma.  The father expresses concern over Toya's lack of awareness of his injuries.  In another panel, a woman with two younger children walks down a school hallway, illustrating the stark contrast between the children's aspirations of heroism and Toya's suffering. A third man observes, commenting that this will soon be a distant memory. The visual elements include expressions of concern, injury, and contrasting settings representing the normalcy of school life and Toya's traumatic situation.
