My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a strategic discussion.  Two characters, seemingly in a vehicle, analyze Shigaraki's recovery timeline, estimating at least two months until his body modifications are complete. This information is corroborated by polygraph results and testimony from captured assassins.  The scene shows a wrecked roadside and a subsequent image of a stormy sea, suggesting the aftermath of a battle, possibly the Tartarus attack. The discussion centers on using this time to prepare an attack on Shigaraki and All for One.
