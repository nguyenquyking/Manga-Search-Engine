My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Mineta Minoru using his Grape-like balls to attack an unseen enemy.  He's shown in multiple panels, reflecting on a past shared experience with another character (possibly Ochaco Uraraka, though not explicitly named). The text highlights Mineta's awe at the other character's strength and their past teamwork.  Mineta's attack is depicted as a powerful, widespread assault.  The final panel shows a close-up of another character, possibly reacting to Mineta's attack.
