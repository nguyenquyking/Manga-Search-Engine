My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya, along with several other characters (partially obscured by motion lines suggesting speed and movement), amidst a chaotic scene.  Midoriya is shown eating while simultaneously stating that things will move quickly from now on.  The background features blurred figures and intense motion lines, implying a high-stakes situation. The panel concludes with Midoriya affirming his readiness, with a "Right!!" speech bubble.  The scene strongly suggests a pivotal moment in the narrative.
