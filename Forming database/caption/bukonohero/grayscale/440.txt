A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a distressed Uraraka Ochaco, her face contorted in worry and fear.  She's observing a scene where a male character (possibly a neighborhood resident) is also visibly anxious.  Uraraka apologizes for her inability to offer reassurance to the people around her, explaining that everyone is gripped by the same fear and unease.  The scene highlights the shared anxiety and the weight of responsibility felt by those witnessing a potentially dangerous situation. The visual style emphasizes the characters' emotional states through linework and expressions.
