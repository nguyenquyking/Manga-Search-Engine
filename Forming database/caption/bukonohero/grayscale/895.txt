My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A grotesque, bald figure with a gaping maw emits energy, possibly a Quirk.  In the background, figures are fighting, possibly using firearms.  In the foreground, a distressed female character, possibly a prisoner (number 656698 visible), witnesses the chaos, expressing concern about the system not responding to Quirks.  The overall tone suggests a breakdown of order and possibly a threat to the functioning of Quirks.
