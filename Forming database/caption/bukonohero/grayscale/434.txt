My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a strategic discussion about Toga Himiko.  The scene shows a character (possibly a staff member or hero) confirming the effectiveness of U.A. High's containment strategy against Toga, whose quirk limitations have been studied.  Another character, possibly a student or teacher, reacts with a determined expression, stating "And it's time for payback," indicating a counter-offensive is planned. The final panel shows a figure possibly being subdued in the rain outside U.A. High.  The overall mood is serious and tense, foreshadowing impending action.
