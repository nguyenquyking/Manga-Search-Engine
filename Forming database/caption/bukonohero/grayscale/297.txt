Here's a caption describing the My Hero Academia manga panel:  A dramatic confrontation between U.S.A. and Cathleen Bate. U.S.A., in a powerful pose, declares victory, while a severely damaged Cathleen Bate, showing signs of decay, defiantly asserts, "...won't decay!"  The scene is filled with intense energy and visual effects, highlighting the clash of powers.
