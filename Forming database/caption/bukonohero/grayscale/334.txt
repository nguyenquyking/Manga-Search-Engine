A colossal, muscular figure, seemingly formed from air, looms over a smaller figure on a jet.  The large figure is the result of a power that expands the user's shape to 1000 times its original size. The smaller figure, possibly a hero, expresses a sense of unease. The scene depicts a powerful display of Quirk usage, with the text implying a forceful impact ("Fist Bump") is imminent.
