My Hero Academia Chapter 336:  The manga panel shows Shoto Todoroki struggling to control both sides of his body,  experiencing internal conflict.  He's shown in two panels: one showing his internal struggle, the other showing him successfully using both sides.  Another panel depicts a conversation between two other characters (one resembling Mirio Togata and another unidentified character) discussing the weakened state of the top villains and the upcoming war.  A final panel shows a large arena-like building with text indicating the "all-out war" and the capture of Gigantomachia.
