My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dramatic aerial scene.  Two characters, seemingly All For One and a female villain, are falling rapidly. All For One is struggling, stating he cannot fly yet and lacks the power to pull them up. The female villain appears to be booby-trapped.  Another character, Hawks, is shown in action, flying downward, possibly heading towards the falling pair.  Narrative boxes reveal All For One gave the villain an extra quirk, and Hawks suspects the villain did not cause her own explosion. The overall scene is fast-paced and action-oriented, emphasizing the characters' perilous situation and the imminent danger.
