My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a young, spiky-haired character, possibly Katsuki Bakugo, reflecting on his past actions. He expresses remorse, stating he needs to apologize to his mother and everyone, and worries about his father's reaction.  The scene shows him in a new living arrangement, with a welcoming message about a new family.  Another panel shows a figure possibly resembling a doctor or caretaker and a younger child, suggesting a supportive environment, but with a final panel suggesting his hope is in vain.  The overall tone is one of guilt, concern, and uncertain hope.
