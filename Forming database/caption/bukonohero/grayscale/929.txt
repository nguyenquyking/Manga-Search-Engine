My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  The top panel shows a close-up of Katsuki Bakugo's intensely angry face, heavily scarred and sweating, with the text "...the look on your face..." indicating his internal rage.  Below, smaller panels show Bakugo and other characters (possibly villains or robots) engaged in fierce combat.  A final panel shows a portion of All Might's back, his long white hair suggesting his weakened state. The scene is chaotic, with explosions and debris, emphasizing the intensity of the battle.
