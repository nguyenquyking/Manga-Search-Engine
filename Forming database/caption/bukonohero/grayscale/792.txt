My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion among characters about Endeavor's mysterious utterance, "One For All," during a confrontation with Shigaraki.  The panel shows several individuals, including Endeavor (implied, not directly visible), reacting to the phrase. A female character with glasses contemplates the meaning and its possible connection to All For One, the supervillain. The scene is tense and suggestive of an important plot development.
