My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All Might and other characters. All Might, with his distinctive spiky blonde hair, is shown in profile, conveying seriousness.  A man, possibly Tsukauchi, holds a piece of paper, seemingly intelligence passed on by All Might. Text indicates All Might's retirement and the delivery of intel to those who earned his trust.  The scene suggests a post-All Might era handover.  Another character expresses relief at a successful mission involving Midoriya (Deku).
