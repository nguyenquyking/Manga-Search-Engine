My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a split scene.  The left side shows a close-up of a blonde female hero, possibly Nejire Hado, with blue goggles, a determined expression, and a star-shaped emblem on her costume. The right side shows a villain, partially obscured, with a red and gray costume and a menacing clenched fist.  The text bubbles reveal the villain's plan to obtain the hero's Quirk and the consequences of the hero's intervention.  The overall mood is tense and suggestive of an impending conflict.
