My Hero Academia manga panel depicting several characters.  A seated figure, possibly a teacher or authority figure, observes a young man with spiky hair who is emitting flames.  Another young man with longer hair smiles reassuringly, stating "that's why we have your back."  Two additional individuals, a woman with dark hair and a cape, and a young man with light hair, stand together, the woman indicating the transference of power to the two younger men.  The young man with spiky hair is shown submerged in dark energy, possibly a manifestation of his power, with the caption "It's fortunate..." and an apology from another character for testing them.  The scene suggests a power transfer and the support of senior figures.
