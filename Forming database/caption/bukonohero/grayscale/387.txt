My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic, fiery scene of destruction. A cloaked figure stands amidst the flames with arms outstretched, seemingly overseeing the devastation.  Other characters, including what appears to be a female character with blue hair, are visible among the wreckage, appearing to be amidst the chaos and destruction. The overall tone is dark and somber.  A second panel shows a character (possibly Tomura Shigaraki) with spiky dark hair, pondering the scene with a contemplative expression.  The text boxes express uncertainty about the value of what the cloaked figure protected.
