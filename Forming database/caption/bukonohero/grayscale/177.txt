Toga Himiko, from My Hero Academia, is shown in a dilapidated room.  The room is heavily damaged, with graffiti that includes "Killer" visible on the walls.  Toga is seen in multiple panels; in one, she stands with her back to the viewer, muttering "You'll pay."  In another panel, she's shown from the chest up, with a frustrated expression, seemingly reacting to the destruction.  A final panel shows her from the waist down, walking away from a wall marked with more graffiti, this time possibly names.  The overall scene depicts a post-battle aftermath, with Toga seemingly responsible for the damage.
