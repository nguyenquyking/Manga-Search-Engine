My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  The scene focuses on the difficulty of locating Shigaraki.  Characters shown include a young blond boy (possibly Denki Kaminari), a woman with dark hair (possibly a female pro-hero), and a young girl with short dark hair (possibly Mei Hatsume).  The discussion centers on three reasons why finding Shigaraki is improbable: his exceptional skills at evasion, the reduced number of heroes available for the search, and the presence of individuals who could activate a significant threat.  The panel showcases strategic planning and acknowledges the challenge posed by Shigaraki's capabilities and the limited resources available to the heroes.
