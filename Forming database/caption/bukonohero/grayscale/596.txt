My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a nighttime cityscape under rain.  A character, possibly Momo Yaoyorozu, is shown mid-flight, using her creation quirk to propel herself with a large, hair-like projectile.  In separate panels, another character, possibly Shoto Todoroki, is seen yelling "Take me to the boss! Now!!" and another panel shows him making a gesture, possibly indicating his increased shot velocity.  A third character, possibly a female, is shown with an intense expression. The overall scene suggests a high-stakes chase or confrontation.
