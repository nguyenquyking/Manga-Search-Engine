My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a group of students gathered around an ill Izuku Midoriya (Deku), who is wrapped in a blanket and resting.  Shoto Todoroki stands prominently beside him, and other classmates including Mina Ashido, Ochaco Uraraka, Tenya Iida, and others are present.  A speech bubble above them reads "GO BEYOND...". The overall mood is one of concern and support.
