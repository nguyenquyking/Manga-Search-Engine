My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large, dark, muscular Nomu collapsing after a battle. Several figures, presumably heroes, are seen in the foreground, some injured and on the ground.  The scene shows significant destruction to the surrounding cityscape.  A speech bubble reveals a character's satisfaction with a successful joint development proposal, implying the Nomu's defeat was part of a larger plan.  The overall tone suggests the culmination of a major event, possibly a successful operation against a powerful villain.
