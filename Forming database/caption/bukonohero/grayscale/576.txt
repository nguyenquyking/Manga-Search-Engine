My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion about a mysterious character. The panel shows a cityscape in the rain and a close-up of a character with bandages covering their face, implying they are scarred.  The dialogue reveals that this character appears silently, possesses numerous quirks (possibly like All For One), is covered in blood and filth concealing scars, yet helps people.  The visual style is consistent with the My Hero Academia manga.
