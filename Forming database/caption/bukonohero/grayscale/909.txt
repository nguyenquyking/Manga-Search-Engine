A chaotic scene unfolds in a My Hero Academia manga panel, depicting widespread destruction.  Buildings are crumbled, and people are injured amidst the wreckage.  People are calling for help ("Call an ambulance!", "Somebody, please!") and expressing shock ("How is this real?", "Wait! Hang on!").  A subsequent panel shows a calm, forested area, contrasting sharply with the devastation. A character, seemingly unaffected, is shown in the final panel, stating, "I need...a new line of work...", implying a shift in focus following the catastrophic event.  No specific character names are visible.
