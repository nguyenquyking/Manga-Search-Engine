My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with Pinky (a character with spiky white hair and dark skin) reporting on the evacuation, and Red Riot (Eijiro Kirishima) arriving late, apologizing.  Kirishima and another character (possibly Mina Ashido) are shown in motion, dynamic lines indicating speed. The final panel shows a comment about Todoroki's manliness. The overall mood is one of action and impending conflict, with a focus on teamwork.
