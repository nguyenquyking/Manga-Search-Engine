My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between All For One and a female character (likely a villain working for him). All For One explains that he has a specific request for her, involving capturing a U.A. high school student who will be operating solo.  He notes that the student was previously a target and that many high-ranking villains will be watching the student from a distance. The female character expresses reluctance but is given the suggestion to wait for a more opportune moment, perhaps a rainy day, when the surveillance might be less effective. The scene includes dialogue bubbles showcasing the characters' interactions and plans. The visual style is consistent with the manga's dark and gritty aesthetic.
