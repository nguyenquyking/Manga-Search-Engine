My Hero Academia Chapter 326: "Who Are You Really?" depicts a post-battle scene.  A figure, seemingly Tomura Shigaraki, stands amidst rubble and large, shattered ice shards in a rain-soaked city.  A statue of All Might stands damaged in the background, illustrating the scale of destruction.  The panels preceding the main scene show a dark, shadowy figure seemingly manipulating ice or earth, suggesting the aftermath of a powerful Quirk-based attack.
