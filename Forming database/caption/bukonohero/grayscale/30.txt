My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large-scale battle scene.  Shoto Todoroki is shown collapsing amidst a massive surge of water and fire, his body partially submerged.  In the background, city buildings are crumbling and engulfed in flames.  A smaller panel shows a close-up of a distressed Shoto, his face expressing pain and exhaustion. The scene suggests a climactic moment of intense destruction, with the caption "To be continued!" indicating the fight's continuation in the next chapter.  The onomatopoeia "FWMP" and "KSHNK" emphasize the sounds of impact and destruction.
