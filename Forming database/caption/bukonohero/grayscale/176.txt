My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a nighttime scene outside a house heavily graffitied with phrases like "Demon," "Toga the Terrible," "Die," "Vampire Demon's Lair," "Scum Family," and "Get Lost."  The graffiti suggests a hostile environment and points to Toga Himiko's involvement.  A character, possibly a civilian, is shown standing near the house, their lower body visible.  The text indicates a failed attempt to deal with a situation involving a "demonic" girl, strongly implying Toga Himiko. The overall mood is dark and ominous.
