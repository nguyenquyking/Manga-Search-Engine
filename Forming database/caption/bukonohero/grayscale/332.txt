My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense strategic discussion. A blonde-haired officer, possibly Commander Agpar, contemplates the situation, considering the use of special authority.  The conversation centers on a powerful regenerating villain ("scumbag") who has escalated from a local threat to a global one.  The officer considers whether to utilize extreme tactics, given the villain's resilience to standard attacks.  Another character, Star, is shown in a previous panel, seemingly engaged in an aerial combat with the villain, highlighting the severity of the threat.
