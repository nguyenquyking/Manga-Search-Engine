A panel from My Hero Academia manga depicts a baby, possibly Tomura Shigaraki as a child, wearing a striped shirt. The baby is shown lying down, arms outstretched, with a wide-open mouth, crying loudly.  Dynamic lines suggest intense emotion and movement. The onomatopoeia "WAHHH" emphasizes the baby's loud cry. The overall scene is chaotic and expressive, focusing on the baby's powerful reaction.
