A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a large explosion. A character, possibly a villain, is falling from the sky, saying "Huh?".  The explosion appears to be the result of a large structure, possibly a building or vehicle, collapsing or being destroyed. The scene is filled with debris and smoke, indicating significant destruction.  The onomatopoeia "BOOM" and "KRMBLL" emphasize the impact and destruction.
