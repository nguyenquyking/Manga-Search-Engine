My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Shoto Todoroki, his face partially obscured by bandages, reacting to a conversation.  He's addressed as "Shoto" and described as a "class act".  The panel also shows Endeavor (Shoto's father), expressing frustration about Shoto's seemingly forgiving attitude, and a younger, bandaged Shoto interacting with another character, possibly a sibling.  The scene focuses on Shoto's emotional state and his relationship with his family.  The overall tone is reflective and somewhat melancholic.
