Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  A dramatic manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  The main focus is on a large, shadowy figure, possibly a villain, being forcefully pulled or restrained.  Text bubbles reveal emotional distress and a declaration of preventing a loved one from being taken away. A smaller figure is seen being launched away by a dark shadowy force (potentially Dark Shadow, a quirk). The panels also show a previous scene of a violent struggle.  The overall mood is one of desperation and fierce conflict.
