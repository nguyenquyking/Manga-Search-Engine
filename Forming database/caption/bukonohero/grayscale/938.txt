My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a fight scene.  A character, possibly a villain, with a dark, masked costume, uses a rope-like ability to restrain and manipulate another character's arm. The restrained character, whose face is partially visible and appears to have spiky blond hair, is shown within a circular energy field or effect. The villain is freeing their own arm from a self-inflicted wound, demonstrating their ability to control and detach parts of their body. The visual style uses dynamic lines and shading to emphasize the action and power of the moment.  The text indicates the characters' thoughts and strategies regarding their abilities.
