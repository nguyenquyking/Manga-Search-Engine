My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense interaction between All Might (severely injured and in his weakened form) and a young Deku.  Deku is determined to protect All Might, despite All Might's insistence that he should focus on his own duty as the wielder of One For All and not worry about him.  The scene highlights Deku's defiance and loyalty, and All Might's acceptance of Deku's actions.  Visual elements include All Might's significantly deteriorated state, Deku's determined expression, and dynamic action lines emphasizing Deku's movement.
