My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Hatsume Mei excitedly presenting a large-scale project.  She explains the project's components: miniaturized segmented blocks launched like drones, a mechanism to counter decay quirks, a shelter and evacuation system.  Another character, likely Momo Yaoyorozu, expresses concern about material shortages and the vast energy requirements due to the ravaged economy.  The visual elements include a complex mechanical structure, robotic workers, and expressions of both excitement and apprehension from the characters.
