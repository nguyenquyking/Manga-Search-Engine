My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large, monstrous creature with butterfly-like wings. A figure stands before it, seemingly dwarfed by its size.  Text bubbles indicate an impending catastrophic event, the ultimate evil, and the futility of stopping it.  Another panel shows a skull-like entity, emphasizing the looming threat.  Finally, two characters, possibly Deku and Bakugo (visual confirmation needed for accurate identification), are shown in separate panels, expressing concern and a sense of inadequacy in the face of the overwhelming evil.  The overall mood is one of impending doom and the characters' helplessness.
