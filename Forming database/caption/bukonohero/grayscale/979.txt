My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A colossal, rock-like figure, possibly a Nomu or manifestation of a Quirk, looms over Endeavor and another hero.  In the lower panel, a scarred, smiling Dabi confronts Endeavor, revealing himself to be alive and refuting Endeavor's belief that his son, Toya, is dead.  Dabi accuses Endeavor of overlooking him due to his fire-based Quirk. The scene is tense and reveals a significant plot point regarding Dabi's identity and survival.
