My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a severely damaged Katsuki Bakugo, his face scarred and broken, amidst a cloud of smoke and debris.  The text bubble states "...that could serve as his vessel," referring to Bakugo’s condition.  In the background, a figure resembling a warped, monstrous All For One is shown engulfed in flames.  A second panel shows a determined-looking Shoto Todoroki observing the scene, seemingly concerned about Bakugo.  The overall scene is chaotic and suggests a significant battle has taken place. The word "WARPED SEEDS..." is visible in a speech bubble near Bakugo.
