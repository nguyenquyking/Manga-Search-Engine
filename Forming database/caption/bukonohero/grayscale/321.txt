A heavily damaged All For One, his face a grotesque skull-like visage, is shown mid-attack, creating a large crater in the ground with a powerful blast.  The image focuses on the villain's destructive power and decaying state.  Speed lines emphasize the force of his attack.  No other characters are visible.
