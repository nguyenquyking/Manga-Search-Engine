My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Tomura Shigaraki, grinning menacingly while holding a katana.  He's observing a scene of destruction; a building is damaged, and another figure (possibly a hero) is seen in the background, looking distraught. Shigaraki states,  "Those heroes were being put through a sieve," suggesting widespread harm inflicted upon heroes.  The scene implies a post-battle scenario, with the narrative emphasizing the severity of the damage and Shigaraki's satisfaction.  The top panel shows footprints in water, possibly suggesting a recent escape or pursuit.
