My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between two young boys, likely siblings, lying down.  One boy, with spiky hair, expresses frustration about the inattention shown to them, possibly due to their perceived status as "failed creations." The other boy, lying down, seems less engaged, though he participates in the conversation.  The dialogue reveals a critical perspective on modern heroes and their impact on children. The scene is set indoors, in a simple room.  The overall mood is one of discontent and weariness.
