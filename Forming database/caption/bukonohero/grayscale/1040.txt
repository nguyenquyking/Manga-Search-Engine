My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene. Tomura Shigaraki, grinning menacingly, unleashes a powerful surge of dark energy,  impacting a figure (possibly a previous wielder of One For All) engulfed in flames.  Another figure, possibly Shoto Todoroki, is shown preparing an attack, indicating "Freeze".  The scene shows Tomura's hatred fueling his power, surpassing the limitations of a rule associated with One For All.  The text emphasizes the intensity of Tomura's rage and its effect on the battle.
