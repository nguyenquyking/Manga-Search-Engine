Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga panel:  **Panel Description:** A black-and-white manga panel depicts a dramatic scene.  Izuku Midoriya lies injured and unconscious, cradled by a shadowy figure, seemingly the Fourth (possibly referring to a Quirk or user).  Midoriya's expression is one of suffering.  The Fourth's face is obscured, but their presence is powerful and imposing.  A speech bubble reveals Midoriya's thoughts, highlighting the Fourth's disruptive Quirk.  The lower panel shows a close-up of another character's sinister-looking mouth, reacting to Midoriya's situation, hinting at recognition or anticipation. The text indicates this is a cliffhanger, with the next chapter's release date.
