My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku) unleashes a powerful water-based attack, a massive wave engulfing an opponent.  The opponent, partially visible, appears to be a large, muscular villain whose energy strands are depicted as tearing away.  Midoriya's expression is determined, and he states that the attack is his "full power."  Narrative text boxes provide commentary on the villain's tactics and Midoriya's improved abilities.
