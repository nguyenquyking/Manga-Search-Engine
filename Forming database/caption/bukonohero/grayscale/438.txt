My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where a visibly distressed blonde-haired male character, possibly a supporting hero, argues with a female character, possibly a hero using a megaphone, about the grime covering them after a battle.  Other heroes are visible in the background taking a break. The female hero insists that only heroes should be covered in grime, while the male character expresses his frustration at being dirty. The overall scene highlights the contrast between the heroes' dedication and the harsh reality of their work.
