A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a tense interaction between Aoyama Yuuga and Kunieda, the Tartarus Jailbreaker.  Aoyama, visibly apprehensive, is addressed by Kunieda, who offers to demonstrate their assassination methods.  The scene includes dialogue referencing Aoyama's past attempts at balancing opposing sides and Kunieda's past as a dictator who failed and thus lost their second chance.  The visual style is characteristic of the manga, using bold lines and shading to emphasize expressions and actions.
