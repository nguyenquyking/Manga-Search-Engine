My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene in Gunga Mountain Villa.  Mr. Compress and Gigantomachia are mentioned in text boxes.  One panel shows an apprehended individual lying on a medical table. Another shows a battle between what appears to be a villain (possibly a Nomu) and a hero with a dark, angular costume, possibly a member of the Meta Liberation Army. The hero is shown attacking the villain.  A wide establishing shot of the mountainous Gunga Mountain Villa is shown in the last panel.
