My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Bakugo using "Coldflame's Pale Blade," a powerful attack creating a large, visually impactful explosion of ice or cold energy.  The panel shows Bakugo's spiky blonde hair and upper body amidst the blast.  Another character, partially visible, is seen in the left panel, seemingly reacting to Bakugo's attack.  Text indicates the attack's name and a thought bubble from the partially visible character suggests the attack is intended to subdue Bakugo.
