A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All Might (in his weakened state) warning someone off-panel about a potential explosion.  The scene shows a rain-soaked city street with a car driving away from an explosion.  All Might speaks, advising caution due to a lack of intel on the opponent.  Another panel shows the shocked reaction to a victory, possibly by the opponent. The overall tone is tense and action-oriented.
