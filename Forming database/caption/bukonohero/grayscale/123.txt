My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Katsuki Bakugo in a dynamic action scene.  Bakugo is urging others to attack, shouting "C'mon! Cram 'em in there!!".  He's shown with spiky blond hair, and his expression is intense.  Another character, possibly Shoto Todoroki, is partially visible reacting with surprise ("Huh?!").  The background shows a chaotic battle with multiple figures engaged in combat, including a dark, swirling vortex created by a character wielding a weapon, possibly  a villain or another hero.  The overall scene is fast-paced and violent, highlighting Bakugo's leadership and aggressive fighting style.
