My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene. A villain, possibly Star and her quirk, is shown in distress, possibly from an attack.  Two other characters, seemingly bystanders, are present. One with red hair observes the scene, while the other, also with red hair, is having their quirk stolen by the villain.  The text indicates the villain's quirk has a new rule preventing it from coexisting with others, hence the theft. The overall tone suggests a high-stakes confrontation.
