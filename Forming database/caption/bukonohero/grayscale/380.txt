My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  All For One and a cat-like character are prominently featured, along with smaller panels showing Shigaraki Tomura and a prison system experiencing a system shutdown. The dialogue focuses on the nature of All For One's quirk and its connection to a data transfer system, which was disrupted by radio waves used by Shigaraki. The issue of one-way versus two-way communication is also raised.  The scene emphasizes the interconnectedness of All For One's consciousness with his quirk and the vulnerability of the prison system.
