My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a training exercise.  A student with a dark, curly afro (likely Nejire Hado) is demonstrating levitation, guided by another student (likely Mirio Togata)  who is observing and providing instructions.  A third student (likely Tamaki Amajiki) watches from below, providing additional commentary on the technique.  The scene shows the student with the afro using a "Float" quirk, achieving controlled levitation and propulsion through the air.  The text bubbles explain the mechanics of the quirk and the training process.
