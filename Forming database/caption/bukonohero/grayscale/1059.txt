My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a fierce battle between Tomura Shigaraki and Izuku Midoriya.  Shigaraki has Midoriya in a powerful grasp, shouting "Midoriya!!"  Midoriya is visibly strained.  Shigaraki declares, "Finally got ahold of you," while Midoriya, partially obscured, states, "One For All is mine..."  The scene is dynamic, with motion lines indicating intense force and speed.  A previous panel shows Midoriya's shocked expression before the attack. The overall tone is one of high tension and conflict.
