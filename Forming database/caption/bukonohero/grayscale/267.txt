The scene shows a devastated cityscape in the background, highlighting the scale of the conflict. One panel features a group of villains, identified as "the remnants of the Liberation Front" and "escaped convicts who serve All For One". The characters discuss the number of remaining threats,  mentioning the recent death of a comrade ("Star's untimely death").  The conversation focuses on the ongoing threat posed by the remaining villains and the expectation that they will recruit more allies.  The visual style is consistent with the My Hero Academia manga.
