My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Top panel shows a woman with short, spiky hair (possibly Himiko Toga) and a man with dark hair, seemingly discussing a target's approach.  Middle panel shows the woman with a determined, slightly pained expression, suggesting internal conflict. Bottom panel features a dramatic action scene where a large, imposing figure (Lady Nagant) is confronted by two individuals, a man and a woman.  The man expresses his honor at meeting Nagant, who is identified in a speech bubble.  The scene is dynamic, suggesting a battle or significant encounter.
