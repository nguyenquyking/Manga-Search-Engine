My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between Tomura Shigaraki and a person implied to be Aizawa.  Shigaraki is shown in close-up, smiling faintly while instructing someone to inform the class president of his successful completion of a task.  A separate panel shows Aizawa, sitting in a hospital bed, seemingly recovering from an injury.  A further panel shows the lower body of a character (possibly Miruko) with a prosthetic leg, indicating an injury. Shigaraki expresses concern over Aizawa's progress, and mentions Kurogiri's status. The overall scene conveys a post-battle situation with characters recovering from injuries and assessing the situation.
