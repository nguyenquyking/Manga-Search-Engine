My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Bakugo and another character (possibly Deku, though his face isn't fully visible) in conversation. Bakugo is questioning the other character's actions, specifically their incomplete notes regarding the successors and their detailed notes about other deaths. The dialogue reveals a power dynamic and mistrust, highlighting Bakugo's skepticism about the character's motives. A notebook page with illegible text is also shown, emphasizing the mystery surrounding the successors.  The visual style is characteristic of My Hero Academia's manga art.
