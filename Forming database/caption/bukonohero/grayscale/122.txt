A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a villain, seemingly Tomura Shigaraki, gleefully using his Decay Quirk to shatter and disperse his opponents.  He is shown in the foreground, laughing maniacally, with text bubbles proclaiming his control over the situation and his plan to send his enemies through warp gates. Background panels show the effects of his Quirk, with debris and warped space.  Another character, possibly a hero, is shown in a smaller panel expressing disbelief and outlining their counter-strategy. The overall scene is chaotic and dynamic, highlighting Shigaraki's overwhelming power and malicious intent.
