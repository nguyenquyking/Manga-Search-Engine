My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a strategic planning session.  Characters include All Might (in his weakened state), a character resembling Hawks (likely carrying a smaller character), and Dabi is implicitly discussed.  The scene focuses on a plan to defeat the villains one by one, specifically targeting Dabi and Shigaraki, by dividing their forces and luring them into traps.  Visual elements include speech bubbles outlining the strategy, a map or tactical board, and a dynamic action panel showing a character (possibly All Might) striking. The overall mood is serious and strategic.
