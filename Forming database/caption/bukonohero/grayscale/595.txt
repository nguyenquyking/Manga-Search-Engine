A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting three characters.  A woman with long hair is shown alongside a subdued, bandaged man who says "Boss...".  She requests, "Bring me to my boss..." while seemingly holding a captured, monstrous, bio-mechanical arm. A man with short hair, holding an umbrella, stands in the rain in the top panel, possibly their boss. The scene suggests a tense interaction within a villainous organization.
