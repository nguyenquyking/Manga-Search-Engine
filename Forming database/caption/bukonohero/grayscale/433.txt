My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene in a hospital.  Medical personnel are shown working on a restrained Nomu-Kurogiri, part of a secret restorative research project.  The narrative mentions the breakthrough achieved by the characters (unnamed in the image) and Mic,  and the impact of Shirakumo's spirit.  A separate panel shows the pulverized copy of a quirk by Mirko.  The final panel shows two characters, one with spiky blond hair, and another with dark hair and an eyepatch, discussing the remaining hope, with the latter describing the hope as faint and elusive.
