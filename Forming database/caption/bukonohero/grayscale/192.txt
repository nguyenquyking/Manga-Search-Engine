My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a strategic discussion and analysis of Tomura Shigaraki's power.  A character, possibly a strategist, directs an action with the words "Split them up," showcasing a sharp attack. Another panel shows analysis of Shigaraki's strength exceeding All For One's, based on data from the Star and Stripe battle.  The analysis also notes a mind-meld-like communication method used by Shigaraki's group.  Smaller panels show an attack scene and possibly a map of Tartarus.
