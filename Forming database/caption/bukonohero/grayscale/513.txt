Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  A tense confrontation between two characters.  One, seemingly distressed, states their intent to help a lost child, while the other, with a determined expression, argues against this unsolicited intervention, defining what constitutes a "true hero" as giving help only when asked.  The visual style is characteristic of the My Hero Academia manga, with dynamic linework and dramatic shading emphasizing the emotional intensity of the scene.  The text boxes reveal a disagreement on heroic action and selfless assistance.
