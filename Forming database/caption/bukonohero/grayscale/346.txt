My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a high-speed aerial chase between two characters.  One character, seemingly the U.S. representative (U.S.A. in the text bubble), is shown in mid-flight, leaving a motion blur. The other character, whose identity is not fully revealed, is seen from the waist up, grinning intensely, seemingly anticipating a confrontation.  A large, bright energy blast or attack is prominent in the background, possibly the source of their propulsion or a recent attack. The overall scene suggests a dynamic, action-packed moment within a larger competition or battle.
