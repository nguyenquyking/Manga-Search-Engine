My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A female character, possibly a hero, with a star-shaped emblem and a mask covering her eyes, is shown in profile view, confidently stating that the remainder of the conflict will be trivial.  She is positioned next to a villain, partially obscured by a breathing apparatus. The villain is shown clenching his fist, suggesting aggression, and internally contemplates the risk of stealing the hero's Quirk.  The scene highlights a power imbalance and the hero's confidence in her own abilities.
