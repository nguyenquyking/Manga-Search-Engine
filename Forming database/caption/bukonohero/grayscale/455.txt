My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  Hawks (with his bird-like features) is shown in the upper left, expressing doubt.  The scene then shifts to a panel showing multiple characters including Bakugo, Todoroki, and other U.A. High students and faculty, reacting to something off-screen.  A subsequent panel features All Might and a smaller, unidentified character.  The dialogue focuses on All Might's financial contributions and Hawks' intuition regarding a quirk evolution.  The overall mood is one of surprise and discussion of significant events.
