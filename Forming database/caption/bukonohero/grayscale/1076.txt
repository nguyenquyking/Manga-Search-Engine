My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a intense battle scene.  A severely damaged, dark figure (possibly a villain) is attacked by multiple dark, chain-like projectiles.  Simultaneously, Izuku Midoriya (Deku) is shown in a separate panel, appearing determined and injured, stating "Little brother...".  Another panel shows a heroic figure, possibly All Might, reacting to the villain's apparent survival with the exclamation "How... are you... not dead yet?!".  The overall scene conveys a fierce and dynamic fight with powerful attacks.
