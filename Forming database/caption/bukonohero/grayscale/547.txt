My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Deku (Midoriya Izuku) smiling broadly, while a shadowy, monstrous figure looms in the background.  Deku's smile is described as inspiring, and he explains that protecting everyone's peace of mind is his motivation. The monstrous figure is urging him to keep away.  Another character, possibly a supporting character, is shown in a smaller panel expressing agreement.  The scene is intense and action-oriented.
