My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya, overwhelmed by rage and immobilized, helplessly watching.  A narrator comments that his immense power is wasted, as he could not protect his friends or teacher, who were forced to defend him. Another panel shows a character (possibly a villain) laughing, reflecting on the mistake of giving such power to someone deemed "worthless".  The scene is rendered in black and white manga style.
