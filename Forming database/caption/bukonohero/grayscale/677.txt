My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a nighttime scene in the rain.  A woman with animalistic features (likely a villain or person with a quirk) is seen interacting with a masked individual (possibly a hero or student, potentially a version of Shoto Todoroki based on the mask style) and another smaller figure.  The scene shows the aftermath of an event, with the larger woman explaining her delayed evacuation, while the masked individual appears anxious.  Background shows city buildings and other fleeing figures. The narration boxes explain the characters' actions and perspectives on the situation.
