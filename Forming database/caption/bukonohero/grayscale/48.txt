My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  A character with spiky red hair, possibly Shoto Todoroki (partially obscured), is shown mid-air, propelled by a powerful, blue-tinged energy burst.  He's engaged in a fierce confrontation with another, less visible character, amidst a torrent of water or ice.  The text bubbles indicate a critical moment, with one character asserting the other "can't even act as a puppet correctly" and predicting they "will never become a hero!" The scene is characterized by intense motion lines and a cool color palette dominated by blues and whites, suggesting a water or ice-based Quirk is in use.
