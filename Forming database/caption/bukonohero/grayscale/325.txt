Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  A colossal, muscular, light-skinned man with long, flowing hair dominates the upper panel, his arms outstretched.  He observes a smaller craft, seemingly piloted by a tiny figure, below him. A speech bubble from the giant figure indicates he's initiating an attack ("...MY CRAFT GOING BOOM SHOULD BLOW HIM TO BITS!!"). The middle panel shows a close-up of the giant's intense facial expression. The bottom panel depicts two men, one with short dark hair and a joyful expression, and another with short, light hair, seemingly observing the events above. The dark-haired man seems to be urging the attack ("DO IT NOW, STAR!!"). The scene is set against a dark, starry background.
