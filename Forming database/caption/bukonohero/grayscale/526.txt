My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A character named Womb, cloaked and facing away, unleashes a swirling, dark, Ragnarok-like attack.  Another character, seemingly Todoroki (based on hair and partially visible face), observes, commenting on the attack's intimidating nature and referencing a past training camp incident. A third character, using Yaoyorozu's insulating tape on their tentacles, is also present.  The overall scene is dark and ominous, emphasizing the power of Womb's attack and the fear it inspires.
