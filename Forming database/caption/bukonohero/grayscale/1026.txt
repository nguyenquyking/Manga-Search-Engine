My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Ochaco Uraraka in mid-air, using her Quirk "Zero Gravity,"  flying through a city street.  She's reacting to a giant villain appearing in the distance, urging for swift evacuation. The scene shows city buildings, vehicles, and a speed limit sign.  Text bubbles indicate her movement ("FLOAT"), the villain's proximity ("THE GIANT VILLAIN IS IN SIGHT!"), the villain's speed ("HE'S FAST!"), and the need for immediate action ("HURRY UP WITH THE EVACUATION!").
