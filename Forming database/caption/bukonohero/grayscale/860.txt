My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Hawks (Keigo Takami) in three distinct scenes.  The top panel shows a young Hawks, seemingly surprised, with the speech bubble "Even have those wings?". The middle panel showcases a chaotic scene of multiple people being thrown through the air by a flurry of feathers, cars and trucks are damaged, implying Hawks' Quirk is in use. The bottom panel shows a softer, childlike Hawks happily hugging a small, indistinct creature.  The overall scene suggests a contrast between Hawks' youthful innocence and his powerful, destructive abilities.
