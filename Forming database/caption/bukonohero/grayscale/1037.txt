My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Nana Shimura (the First One For All user) explaining the nature of quirks and their connection to the wielder's consciousness.  The panel shows All Might's memory of Nana, a young Tomura Shigaraki looking upset, and a younger Izuku Midoriya looking at a photo of Nana and a child.  The scene shows Nana's ability to interact with the consciousness within quirks, All Might remembering Nana, Shigaraki's emotional reaction, and Midoriya's contemplation of Nana's legacy.  The visual style is consistent with My Hero Academia's action-oriented manga art.
