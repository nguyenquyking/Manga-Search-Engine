A panel from My Hero Academia manga depicts a seated, masked man in a suit, connected to a breathing apparatus, flanked by two brain-like figures.  The man is centrally positioned, suggesting importance.  The brain-like figures appear to be his subordinates.  Text bubbles indicate a crucial moment is approaching, and that a successful game of hide-and-seek has distracted authorities, creating an opportunity for the central figure. The scene is dark and ominous.
