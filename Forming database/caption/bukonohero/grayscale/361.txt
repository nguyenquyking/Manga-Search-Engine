This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a conversation between Star and Stripe and another masked individual (possibly a villain).  The setting shifts from a global view showing the spread of organized crime to a close-up on the two characters, and finally to a view of the Statue of Liberty in New York City.  The dialogue focuses on the challenges of international crime and the strength of the American hero, Star and Stripe, who is described as "the strongest woman around."  The visual elements highlight the global scope of the problem and the powerful presence of Star and Stripe in the United States.
