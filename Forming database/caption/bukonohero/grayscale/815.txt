A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large, burning building in the background.  In the foreground, a severely injured Katsuki Bakugo lies on a couch, seemingly numb to the pain.  He is heavily bandaged, his expression stoic.  The narrative text boxes discuss the extent of the damage and Bakugo's father's resilience and the necessity for a public statement regarding the situation.  The overall mood is serious and somber.
