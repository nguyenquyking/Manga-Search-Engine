A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Endeavor's reflections on his children.  The scene shows baby Fuyumi sleeping, followed by a younger Endeavor with his daughter Toya.  Narrative boxes reveal Endeavor's disappointment that neither child possessed the ideal quirk he desired (a combination of fire and ice), focusing his ambitions on Toya due to his greater potential.  Endeavor's wife's desire for more children to support each other is also shown.  Visual elements include close-ups of the babies and Endeavor interacting with Toya.
