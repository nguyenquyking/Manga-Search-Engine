My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  A blonde-haired character, possibly a younger sibling, sits on the ground questioning the older, spikier-haired character who is standing. The older character reflects on their past encounter, implying a significant event in a shared room initiated the conflict.  The dialogue indicates a pivotal moment, possibly a confrontation between siblings, where the younger character questions the older's motives and the possibility of ending their conflict.  Another panel shows the older character with a third individual, further emphasizing the weight of their decision and the potential consequences.  The visual elements suggest a post-battle or tense setting, possibly a destroyed room.
