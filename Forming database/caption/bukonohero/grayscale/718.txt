My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A muscular, enraged villain, possibly Muscular, is shown mid-attack, his speech bubble expressing anger and rejection of sympathy.  A smaller character, possibly Kota, observes the scene with a serious expression, his speech bubble indicating a reflection on violence and blood.  The panel shows a contrast between the villain's destructive power and the child's contemplative observation.
