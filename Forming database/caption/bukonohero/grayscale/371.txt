A monochrome manga panel depicts Tomura Shigaraki standing over a defeated, brain-exposed villain.  Shigaraki, with his distinctive white hair and decaying features, wears a dark coat and pants.  Thought bubbles above him read "GOOD QUESTION" and "WHAT EXACTLY AM I?". The villain below is largely obscured but displays exposed brain matter and decaying flesh, suggesting severe injury. The scene is set against a light sky, with radiating lines emanating from beneath the villain, emphasizing the defeat.  The panel ends with "To be continued!"
