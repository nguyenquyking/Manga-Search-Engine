My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A villain, partially obscured, retreats, with the text "I should retreat like I was told" and "For now..." indicating their action.  Izuku Midoriya (presumably) is shown falling or jumping away, with the text "...you've got any options."  A young female character, possibly a student, expresses concern with a worried facial expression and the text "Don't go thinking...". The scene is dark and dramatic, emphasizing the danger.
