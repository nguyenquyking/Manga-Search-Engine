This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts Star and Stripe, the U.S.A.'s number one hero, standing on a futuristic aircraft carrier.  She is using her Quirk, which is highly classified but allows her to assign rules to targets by touching them and naming them.  The panel showcases the immense power and scope of her Quirk, visually represented by a large, dark, energy-like aura emanating from her.  The text boxes explain the constraints placed on her Quirk by the U.S. government and the narrator's understanding of how her power works.  Another character, partially obscured, is visible in the lower right corner seemingly piloting the aircraft.  The background includes a view of the White House, establishing the location.
