A manga panel depicts a dramatic scene where multiple characters react to a powerful explosion.  The central focus is a large speech bubble proclaiming "GREAT EXPLOSION MURDER GOD DYNAMIGHT!!"  Smaller panels show various characters' reactions:  One character calls the scene "childish," another finds it "disturbing," and a third deems it "tacky."  A final panel shows a character gleefully laughing, "Ha Ha!"  The overall scene suggests a battle or intense moment, with the dominant visual being the explosive force and the varied responses to it.
