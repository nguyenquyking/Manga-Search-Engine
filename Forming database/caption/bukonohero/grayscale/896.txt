My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A man, possibly a subordinate, urgently calls out "Boss!" to a superior who appears to be contemplating a command.  Another scene shows a group of figures, seemingly villains, preparing for action near a bridge, with one voicing impatience ("Gimme a break!").  A third panel introduces Shigaraki, whose presence suggests a significant event is unfolding. The overall scene is tense and suggests impending conflict, with a focus on a bridge as a key location.
