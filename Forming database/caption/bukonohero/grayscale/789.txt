A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a serious discussion between Endeavor (Number One Hero, visibly injured and bandaged) and Hawks. Hawks, holding a phone, proposes a team-up of the top three heroes to alleviate Endeavor's burden.  The scene emphasizes the weight of responsibility on Endeavor and Hawks's supportive offer.  A third character, seemingly a doctor or medical professional, is visible in a smaller panel.  The dialogue focuses on the Todoroki family's past and the shared responsibility moving forward.
