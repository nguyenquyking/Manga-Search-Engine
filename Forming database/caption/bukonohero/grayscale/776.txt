My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between All Might (long, light-colored hair) and a younger, masked character (possibly a student). All Might expresses disbelief ("O ay! (No way!)") at the younger character's statement regarding their life or the life of One for All.  The scene shows a flashback to All Might's past, highlighting his unique endurance with One for All compared to others who possessed it before him. The narrative emphasizes the physical and emotional burden of wielding One for All.  The final panel shows All Might in contemplation, linking his experience to the information he must reveal ("...to what we must tell you").
