My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes:  Shoto Todoroki looks concerned; Izuku Midoriya hugs someone (possibly Ochaco Uraraka); various students, including Bakugo, are shown interacting; a wide shot shows the group 30 kilometers from U.A. High School. The overall tone suggests successful mission completion despite unforeseen circumstances.
