Here's a caption describing the My Hero Academia manga panel:  A rain-soaked scene depicts a distraught Izuku Midoriya kneeling on the ground, his head bowed. A young boy, possibly Kota Izumi, rushes towards him, seemingly concerned.  A woman, possibly Ryukyu, stands in the background, appearing shocked or distressed, hands raised. The text box above reads "The story of how we all became the greatest heroes," indicating a narrative turning point.  The scene ends with "To be continued!"
