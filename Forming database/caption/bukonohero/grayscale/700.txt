My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya (Deku) lying in a hospital bed, holding hands with Ochaco Uraraka.  All Might stands beside them, looking concerned.  Another panel shows a worried young woman, possibly a relative or friend, looking at Deku.  The dialogue reveals that Deku is targeted, and arrangements are being made for his protection outside of U.A. High.  All Might's words suggest Deku's power is linked to his quirklessness.
