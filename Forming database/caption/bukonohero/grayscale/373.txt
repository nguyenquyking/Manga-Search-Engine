My Hero Academia: Tomura Shigaraki stands on a giant brain, enveloped by dark, shadowy hands reaching up from below against a fiery sunset backdrop. He wears a dark cloak and suit, his white hair disheveled.  Speech bubbles above him read "Well...?" and "Who am 'I' indeed?". The image is stylized and dramatic, emphasizing Shigaraki's uncertain identity or internal conflict.
