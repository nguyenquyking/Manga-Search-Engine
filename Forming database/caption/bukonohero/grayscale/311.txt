Here's a caption describing the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  A severely damaged All Might, his body disintegrating, salutes while declaring,  "This is my way of paying you back."  A distressed expression is visible despite his determined posture.  In a smaller panel, a villain in a gas mask is shown, with the text "Move faster!! Dammit!!" indicating urgency. The overall image conveys a climactic battle scene, highlighting All Might's sacrifice.  The stylistic choices suggest a digitally enhanced manga panel.
