My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conflicted Shigaraki Tomura.  A large, decaying Shigaraki dominates the top panel, his internal struggle evident in his dialogue ("I can truthfully declare that I am Tomura Shigaraki…but at the same time, there is no doubt that I am also me"). A smaller, more defined Shigaraki figure is partially visible atop the larger one, observing the scene. The lower panel shows a character evading an attack labeled "Radio Waves plus Air Cannon…plus Heavy Payload," with the smaller Shigaraki observing.  The scene highlights Shigaraki's internal conflict and the power of his attacks.
