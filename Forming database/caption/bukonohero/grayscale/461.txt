My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic scene. A large crowd of civilians, some holding umbrellas, are shown reacting with fear and awe.  In the foreground, a distressed Izuku Midoriya is surrounded by several monstrous figures with gaping mouths, representing the spreading unease.  A smaller character, possibly a young girl, cries nearby.  Another character, possibly a hero, is visible in the bottom right corner, seemingly observing the situation.  Speech bubbles indicate the crowd's pleas for a break and Midoriya's internal struggle, with one bubble stating "No Way!"  The overall mood is tense and unsettling.
