My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Toga Himiko launching a powerful attack, creating a large explosion.  She's smiling and airborne.  Another panel shows a close-up of Himiko Toga's face, expressing her rationale.  Additional panels show Dabi (likely) falling, and a conversation between Himiko Toga and another character (possibly Toya Todoroki).  The overall scene is action-packed, showing the villains' destructive capabilities and their dialogue revealing their motivations and strategies.
