A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Izuku Midoriya in a dimly lit room.  A screen shows a man in a suit, All For One, clapping.  Text bubbles indicate All For One is addressing Midoriya, asking if he enjoyed his Q&A session with Lady Nagant.  The scene suggests a post-event debrief or a clandestine message.  The overall tone is serious and suspenseful.
