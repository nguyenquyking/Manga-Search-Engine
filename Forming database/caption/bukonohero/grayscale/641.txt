Here's a caption describing the My Hero Academia manga panel:  A dynamic action scene unfolds in a city setting.  A character with spiky hair, possibly  a hero, is seen launching an attack, indicated by intense energy lines, towards a large, heavily armored opponent who is falling from a skyscraper. The attacker says, "...I'M NOT IN THE SMOKE!" while the falling opponent comments, "TOO BAD...".  The attack causes a significant explosion on the building's rooftop.  The overall style is dark and gritty, typical of the My Hero Academia manga.
