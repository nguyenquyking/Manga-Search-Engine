A panel from My Hero Academia manga shows a heavily muscled, bloodied Deku in a distressed but triumphant pose.  His body is partially transformed, with dark, organic-looking muscle fibers extending from his arms and torso. He is shouting, expressing relief at escaping a dangerous situation and looking forward to a better outcome.  The speech bubbles convey his thoughts on narrowly avoiding death and his eagerness to move on. The background suggests a recent intense battle.
