My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  Izuku Midoriya is shown mid-air, launching a powerful attack,  a large burst of energy emanating from his hands.  He is facing off against another character (unidentifiable from this crop) who is also airborne.  In the background, a cityscape is visible.  A third character, possibly Shoto Todoroki judging by the hair style, is seen in a separate panel, observing the fight. The text indicates a challenge and a determination to support Midoriya.
