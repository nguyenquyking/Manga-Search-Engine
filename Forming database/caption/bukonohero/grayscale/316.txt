My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a large, monstrous being, possibly Tiamat, being redirected by a character, possibly a hero, who is shown detaching his arm at the elbow to achieve this.  The scene shows a missile-like object and a UFO-like craft.  Text indicates a "New Order" is being implemented, and that Tiamat's redirection applies even to single missiles. The hero's action is described as "ripping his arm off at the elbow" to perform the redirection.  The final panel shows a fiery explosion.
