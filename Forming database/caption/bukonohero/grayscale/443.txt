My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a distraught Izuku Midoriya, labeled as such, amidst a crowd.  Other characters are present, including one visibly upset female character (possibly Ochaco Uraraka), and another male character expressing concern.  The scene is rainy, and the crowd shows concern and empathy for Midoriya.  Text bubbles highlight the sentiment that Midoriya needs help and rest, emphasizing that he's still learning to manage his responsibilities as a high school student and hero.
