My Hero Academia manga scene:  A severely injured Twice (with his multiple faces visible), is questioned by a seated, shadowy figure in a dark, cavernous location.  A second figure, possibly a subordinate, observes from behind.  Another panel shows a figure, possibly Shigaraki, emerging from a tunnel, reacting to something. The overall mood is tense and ominous.
