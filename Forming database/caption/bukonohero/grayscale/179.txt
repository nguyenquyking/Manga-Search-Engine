My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Himiko Toga.  The scene shows Toga in her room, observing a sleeping person from a distance.  Toga expresses fascination with the sleeping individual's cuteness and dimples, imagining them as a bird.  The panel also includes a smaller image of a bird and Toga's inner monologue that reveals her recurring dreams.  The overall mood is suggestive and slightly unsettling.
