My Hero Academia manga chapter depicts Dabi (bandaged face, partially shown) contemplating his origin and the Todoroki family situation.  Shoto Todoroki (half-white, half-black hair) is shown in a separate panel, seemingly aware of the gravity of the situation.  Another character, possibly a villain, is shown cleaning up, indicating a significant event's aftermath.  A text bubble states "Endeavor's in trouble," suggesting the pro-hero is facing a crisis. The next chapter's release date is announced.
