A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a severely injured Katsuki Bakugo, his face scarred and his hands covering his mouth in shock.  The scene shows him reacting to news about the extent of his injuries and the permanent changes to his body and abilities following a major battle. Text boxes explain that despite extensive regenerative efforts, his body is debilitated, his senses dulled, and his power diminished permanently.  The visual style is gritty and emphasizes the severity of his condition.
