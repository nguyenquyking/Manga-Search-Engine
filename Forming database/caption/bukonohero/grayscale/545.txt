A chaotic scene unfolds in a My Hero Academia manga panel.  A large, ice-like blast, labeled "BAM," impacts a group of heroes and civilians.  Numerous heroes, including recognizable figures (though precise identification needs further context), are scattered amidst the debris.  In the foreground, several civilians, appearing injured or distressed, huddle near a seemingly injured or unconscious individual on the ground. The overall atmosphere is one of intense conflict and destruction.
