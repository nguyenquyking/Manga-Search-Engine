My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  A character, presumably Izuku Midoriya (Deku), is shown launching a powerful "Detroit Smash" attack, a large, explosive burst of energy emanating from his fist.  The force of the attack sends another character flying backward.  The panels leading up to this show three quick strikes ("three flyby hits") against an opponent before the final, decisive "Detroit Smash".  The visual style emphasizes speed and impact with motion lines and impact effects.
