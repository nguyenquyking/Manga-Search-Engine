My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a character, possibly the ninth user of a powerful Quirk, in action.  The character is shown mid-movement, using what appears to be a jetpack or similar propulsion device, with smoke or exhaust visible.  The focus is on strategic thinking, advising the character to approach the situation tactically rather than relying solely on raw power.  The text emphasizes the need to view their abilities ("quirks") as tools within a larger strategy, not as ultimate moves. The character's design is heavily armored, suggesting a defensive approach.
