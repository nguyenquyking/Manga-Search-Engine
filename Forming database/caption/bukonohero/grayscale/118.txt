My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where several characters react to Shigaraki's drastically altered appearance and power.  Shigaraki, with a significantly transformed body and multiple decaying hands extending from his arm, is the focal point.  Other characters, including Dynamight (possibly speaking to another unseen character), express shock and concern.  The text indicates uncertainty regarding Shigaraki's current state and the strategic implications.  The overall tone suggests a high-stakes situation.
