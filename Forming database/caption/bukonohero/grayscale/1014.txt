My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Tsuyu Asui.  Asui, in her hero costume, is shown forcefully repelling multiple floating objects labeled "ZERO SATELLITES!"  She states, "I've shut those feelings away." A subsequent panel shows a close-up of Asui's determined expression and another panel shows her earlier, knocked down, touching the objects.  A small panel shows another character stating "Exactly!" indicating agreement with Asui's action.  The scene implies Asui's emotional control and her use of her Quirk.
