My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A powerful villain, seemingly with spiky hair and intense eyes, is destroying the city, stating "I love it out here...". Another character, possibly a hero, vows to "demolish him,"  while civilians flee in terror, with one urging others to run from the "blood-crazed villain."  The town is shown in disarray with damaged buildings and scattered debris.  A worried onlooker expresses concern about the town being "torn apart."
