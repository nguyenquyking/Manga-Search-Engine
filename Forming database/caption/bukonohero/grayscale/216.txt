My Hero Academia manga panel depicting Sun Eater (a female hero in a form-fitting suit) amidst a smoky aftermath.  Several other heroes, including Fatgum (in a large, hooded coat) and others, are present, embracing and checking on each other.  The scene suggests a recent battle with villains, with debris and smoke in the background.  The dialogue indicates relief and gratitude among the heroes, along with concern about the lack of information (intel) due to fewer people present.  The heroes are also discussing moving to Shiketsu High.
