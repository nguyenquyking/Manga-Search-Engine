My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between a villain (unidentified, possibly a member of the League of Villains) and what seems to be an unseen individual.  The villain is giving orders,  demanding the location of U.A. High's training camp and information about when Class 1-A will be isolated. The villain's motivations are stated as acting in the service of others and pursuing their happiness. The villain also references Izuku Midoriya's return to U.A. and a plan to lure him somewhere alone.  A close-up panel shows a seemingly surprised or shocked reaction from Izuku.  A final panel reveals a note left by someone, potentially relating to Izuku being quirkless.
