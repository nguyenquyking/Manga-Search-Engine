My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a monstrous, many-armed figure, possibly a villain, central to the image.  The figure is surrounded by a multitude of hands, creating a chaotic and unsettling scene. Text bubbles express the figure's disdain for those who ignore the inevitable. In a separate panel, a character, possibly Ochaco Uraraka judging by her appearance, runs, urgently needing "some spares," possibly referring to mechanical components.  The scene suggests a desperate situation amidst a chaotic and powerful threat.
