My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  One character, with spiky dark hair and facial scarring, expresses concern about the other's plan to get injured before reaching the battlefield, noting the limitations of their reinforcement parts. The other character, with shorter, dark hair, explains that their meta-ability evolved uniquely due to One For All's strength increase, and that using it was a last resort.  The scene focuses on their dialogue and facial expressions.
