Here's a caption for the provided My Hero Academia manga image:  Izuku Midoriya, Shoto Todoroki, and Katsuki Bakugo are shown in a determined close-up.  Midoriya is central, with Todoroki partially visible to his left and Bakugo to his right.  A speech bubble above Midoriya declares their intention to defeat Shigaraki and All For One.  The image ends with "To be continued!" indicating a cliffhanger.
