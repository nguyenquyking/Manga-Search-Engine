My Hero Academia Chapter 304:  A group of heroes, including Izuku Midoriya (partially shown, large and looming),  are gathered in a large, ornate room.  They are seated on elaborate chairs around a central point.  Other identifiable heroes include Shoto Todoroki, and several others whose identities are less clear.  Midoriya appears to be unconscious or in a weakened state.  The scene suggests an impending conversation or confrontation.  The text indicates that a discussion is about to take place before Midoriya wakes up.
