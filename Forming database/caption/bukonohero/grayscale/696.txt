My Hero Academia manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Top panel shows Izuku Midoriya (Deku) activating his quirk with a determined expression, stating "No matter what happens to me!!".  The next row shows All Might on a phone call, a brief action scene with what appears to be a villain, and then a character (likely Hawks) on a phone, saying "I'm on my way!". The final panel shows Hawks on a phone call, observing a scene where a villain is seemingly defeated by Midoriya, asking if Midoriya is okay.  Key visual elements include action lines indicating movement and power, speech bubbles conveying dialogue, and the overall style of the My Hero Academia manga.
