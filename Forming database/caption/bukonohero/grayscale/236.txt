My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Izuku Midoriya (deduced from art style), is shown reacting with concern and distress. Another character uses a light refraction ability, launching a laser beam ("LASER!!").  The text indicates near-death experiences ("We coulda been killed, time after time") and the current widespread destruction ("...all of Japan").  The visual style is dynamic, with motion lines and onomatopoeia emphasizing the laser's power and speed.
