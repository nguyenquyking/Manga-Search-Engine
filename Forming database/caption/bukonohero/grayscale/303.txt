My Hero Academia manga panel depicting All For One in a massive, destructive, Quirk-based attack.  He's shown unleashing a wave of power that engulfs and seemingly destroys multiple figures. The text bubble states "...revolts against other quirks!!"  The lower panel shows a close-up of a character's face, possibly reacting to the events above, with speech bubbles reading "...BATE!!" and "Cathleen...". The scene is chaotic and filled with dark, intense shading.
