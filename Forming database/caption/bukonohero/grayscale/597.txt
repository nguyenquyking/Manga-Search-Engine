My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a high-speed projectile, possibly a missile or energy blast, streaking across a cityscape.  The projectile is labeled "BLAM" twice, indicating impact or explosions.  A character, partially visible in the lower panel, seems to be observing or reacting to the event.  The text suggests the scene is about the consequences of a fatal screw-up, regardless of the victim's identity, with strategic considerations for slowing down a target. No specific character names are visible. The overall mood is tense and dramatic.
