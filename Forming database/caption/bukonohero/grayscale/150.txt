My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters amidst a global crisis.  Aoyama, visibly concerned, questions the situation, while another character (possibly a woman, only partially visible) explains the devastating consequences of Japan's economic collapse and subsequent villain uprisings: widespread chaos, record unemployment, loss of faith in currencies, and a global crisis mirroring the Great Depression. The scene features a background illustration showing a city in ruins amidst a chaotic crowd.
