My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a high-speed chase.  A blonde-haired character (likely All Might or a similar character) is being targeted by an assassin in a hooded coat.  The assassin fires shots, forcing the blonde character to evade while protecting a boy (not clearly visible, but implied by the text).  The scene shows the assassin's attacks, the blonde character evading in a vehicle, and the aftermath of explosions or energy blasts.  The setting appears to be an urban environment.  The text indicates a deliberate attempt to separate the blonde character and the boy.
