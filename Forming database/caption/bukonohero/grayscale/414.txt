My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where All Might is discussed.  A woman with long hair is shown, possibly being comforted or held by another person.  Text boxes reveal that this woman was the last person All Might saved, and she regularly purges blasphemous acts against heroes.  Another panel shows a devastated cityscape and a figure that might be All Might, injured. The overall tone is somber and reflective.
