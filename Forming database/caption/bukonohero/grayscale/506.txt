My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  Minoru Mineta is shown to be absent ("That old me is gone").  A character, possibly Nejire Hado, is shown in motion, launching herself forward with great speed ("You're not going anywhere!").  Blackwhip, a quirk, is actively used, combining with other powers (possibly One For All and possibly another move called "Fajin") for enhanced speed and attack. The overall scene suggests a high-stakes confrontation.
