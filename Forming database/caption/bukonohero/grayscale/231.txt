My Hero Academia Chapter 337: A Disposable Life.  The scene depicts Izuku Midoriya observing three figures—a girl with long hair, a shorter person in a dark outfit, and another individual—in a forest.  Midoriya's internal monologue reflects on his perception of these individuals as expendable tools.  In a subsequent panel, the girl (likely Ochaco Uraraka) is seen urging Yuga Aoyama to flee from an unseen threat, indicating an urgent situation.
