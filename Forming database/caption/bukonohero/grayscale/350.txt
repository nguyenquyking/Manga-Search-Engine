My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character with long hair, possibly a female villain, holds a powerful laser beam, stating "The laser is holdable!". Another character, seemingly a hero,  is shown severely injured, with text indicating his opponent's rapid healing. A third character, possibly a hero, is using immense strength for midair mobility, aiming for an attack.  The scene suggests the villain's power is weakening, as the vacuum she created is gone, and the hero is seizing the opportunity to attack.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed, focusing on the characters' abilities and the dynamic of the fight.
