My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  Izuku Midoriya (Deku) is central,  moving rapidly with Endeavor and Hawks, their faces partially obscured by motion lines.  They are shown in a determined, forward-moving posture.  A partially visible character, possibly Mirko or another hero, is also present. The text indicates a forthcoming team-up between the Top Three heroes (Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist - implied) and Deku and All Might to settle the score with the League of Villains.  The overall visual style suggests intense speed and impending conflict.
