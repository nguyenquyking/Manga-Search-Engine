My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Uraraka Ochaco expresses concern, stating "Things are different now...".  Another panel shows Ochaco and Tsuyu Asui discussing Bakugo's rescue, with Ochaco suggesting it's "disgraceful" to need rescuing.  Deku is shown reacting with shock and determination.  The final panel depicts a powerful energy blast or movement, possibly Deku's quirk, with a smaller figure (possibly someone being rescued) moving at high speed.  The text "Including me!!" indicates someone joining the action.
