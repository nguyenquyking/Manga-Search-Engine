A My Hero Academia manga panel depicts Ochaco Uraraka falling from a great height between buildings in the rain.  Below, a large crowd of people with umbrellas observes, with some shouting in surprise.  The text "Ochaco?!" and "Uraraka?!" appear in speech bubbles, indicating their shock.  In smaller panels, other characters react to the event with expressions of alarm. The word "FLOO" appears in large stylized letters suggesting the sound of her fall.  A speech bubble above states, "...is a safe place to sleep at night!!", possibly indicating the irony of the situation.
