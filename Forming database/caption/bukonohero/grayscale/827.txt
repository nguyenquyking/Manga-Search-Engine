This My Hero Academia manga panel depicts a tense family confrontation.  Young Shoto Todoroki, visibly distressed and engulfed in flames emanating from his quirk, confronts his father, Endeavor.  Endeavor's face is grim, reflecting his concern.  Younger versions of Shoto, along with his siblings (implied by their presence), are also shown, highlighting the emotional weight of the scene.  Shoto's declaration, "You lit this fire in me, Dad...and it's not going out!", underscores the conflict's core.  The word "BWOOM" visually represents the intensity of Shoto's fire quirk.
