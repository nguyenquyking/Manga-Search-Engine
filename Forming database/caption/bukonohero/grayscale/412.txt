My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a contemplative Todoroki Shoto, feeling increasingly distant from heroism, amidst a crowd of heroes.  A subsequent panel shows a dynamic action scene where a villain, possibly a Nomu or a similar threat, attacks Todoroki from behind.  The villain wields a blade, and Todoroki's back is to the viewer, suggesting an imminent confrontation. The scene is set in the rain.
