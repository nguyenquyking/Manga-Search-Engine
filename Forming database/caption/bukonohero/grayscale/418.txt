My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  A severely scarred Stain, the villain who murdered 40 heroes, stands in the rain, his expression grim.  Shoto Todoroki is shown partially, seemingly observing Stain.  A smaller panel shows a female character (possibly a bystander) closing an umbrella under clearing skies.  The scene suggests a moment of reflection or decision before a potential conflict.  The text indicates Stain's actions and Todoroki's motivation.
