My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where a character, possibly Izuku Midoriya (based on hair style), is undergoing an organ transplant.  He is shown experiencing psychological effects related to the procedure, specifically dreams involving the quirks he’s stolen. The panel shows inner monologue detailing these dreams and the guilt he feels, contrasted with a doctor's explanation of the root cause of these issues.  The visual style is typical My Hero Academia manga, with dramatic shading and speech bubbles containing internal thoughts.
