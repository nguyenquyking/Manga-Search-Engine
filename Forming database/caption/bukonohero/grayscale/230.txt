A My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene with Mei Hatsume and Izuku Midoriya.  Hatsume is positioned above Midoriya, appearing to have him pinned.  She is smiling and says, "Hey there! It's been forever, Midoriya!"  The panel ends with "To be continued!"  Midoriya's expression is one of apparent surprise or discomfort. The overall visual style is consistent with the My Hero Academia manga.
