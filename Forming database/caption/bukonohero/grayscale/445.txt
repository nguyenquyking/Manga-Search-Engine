My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a narrative split into three sections.  The first shows a hero, possibly All Might, in a dynamic pose, possibly falling. The second shows Izuku Midoriya and Ochaco Uraraka together, smiling, on a snowy day. The third shows Ochaco smiling contentedly, juxtaposed with a dark, monstrous figure seemingly emerging from the ground, implying a foreshadowing of danger or a challenge.  The text boxes indicate a narrative shift, possibly referring to Midoriya's journey to becoming a hero and a bad omen.
