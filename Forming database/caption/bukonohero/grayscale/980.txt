My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a scene where a character, likely Shoto Todoroki, offers to provide a DNA sample to prove a claim.  The scene shows Todoroki offering blood or skin for a DNA test, reacting to a public DNA test result showing a 99.9% match between his DNA and Endeavor's (his father) blood sample from a battle in Kyushu. Other characters are present, including Dabi (in the background) and a masked figure. A large screen displays the test results publicly. The overall mood is one of revelation and potential conflict.
