My Hero Academia manga panel depicting a tense scene.  A young, blonde boy, possibly a student, looks shocked and asks about the affiliation of a powerful, dark, monstrous figure.  Other students are running in the background, possibly escaping danger. The monstrous figure, possibly a villain, initially appears menacing but later reassures onlookers that they are fine. The scene suggests a confrontation or aftermath of a battle involving All For One. The visual style is consistent with the manga's gritty, action-oriented aesthetic.  The text bubbles contain dialogue expressing concern, surprise, and relief.
