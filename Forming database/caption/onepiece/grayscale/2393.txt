One Piece manga panel depicting Okobore, a town described as existing on scraps discarded by officials beyond a large torii gate.  The top panels show a panoramic view of Okobore, highlighting its impoverished state.  The bottom panel shows a close-up of Zoro (identifiable by his distinct hairstyle and swords) in action, seemingly engaged in combat or a swift movement, with a woman nearby reacting to his action. The scene conveys the stark contrast between the wealthy officials and the impoverished residents of Okobore.
