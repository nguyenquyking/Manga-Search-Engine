A One Piece manga panel depicting Lord Momonosuke's transformation and flight.  A large, winged figure, Momonosuke, is shown flying, causing reactions of fear and surprise from other characters.  One character expresses fear ("It's high!! I'm scared!!"), while another shouts "What?! He's flying!!".  Momonosuke himself is shown reacting to the transformation with sounds of exertion ("Ooh, ouch... huff!!").  The scene includes onomatopoeia depicting the speed and force of his flight ("FWOOSH," "FWAP," "GATCHI," "NG!!!").  Other characters are present, observing the event with expressions of shock and concern.  The overall setting appears to be indoors, within a wooden structure.
