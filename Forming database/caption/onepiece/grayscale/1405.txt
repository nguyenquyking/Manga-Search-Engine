One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  Boss Kyoshiro, visibly angry, warns of an immediate attack on Onigashima.  Another panel shows a group of characters, including Kin'emon, reacting with excitement to an impending battle.  The central focus is a discussion around Lord Yasui's riddle, involving the interpretation of "Habu Port" and "Tokage Port," and how Kin'emon cleverly misled the spy Orochi by misinterpreting the riddle's answer.  The riddle's solution and the spy's actions are explained through text.  Visual elements include speech bubbles, character expressions, and a symbol representing the riddle.
