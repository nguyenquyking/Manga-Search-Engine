One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic battle scene. Roronoa Zoro,  wounded and with a sword in his mouth,  is shown reacting in surprise ("Huh?!").  He is engaged in combat with an unseen opponent, possibly  a large entity whose glowing eye is visible in the lower panel.  The scene is filled with explosions and debris, suggesting a powerful attack.  Another character, partially obscured, appears in the background.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.  The style is reminiscent of One Piece manga art.
