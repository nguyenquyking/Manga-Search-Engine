One Piece manga panel depicting the Ryugu Palace in the Ryugu Kingdom on Fish-Man Island.  Monkey D. Garp is seen inside a transparent sphere, seemingly observing the scene. Neptune, the Fish-Man King, interacts with Garp, expressing concern over his fatigue.  A woman, possibly a member of Neptune's family, is also present, showing concern for Garp. The overall scene is celebratory, following the completion of a journey, yet also suggests the chaotic nature of the Reverie.  The panel showcases the opulent architecture of the Ryugu Palace with a dragon-like figure prominently displayed.
