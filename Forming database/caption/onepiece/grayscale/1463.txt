One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene. A man in a kimono is thrown into a pot, yelling "HELP! HELP MEEE!!!"  Another character, seemingly a cook, observes with the words "NO MORE JOKES! DON'T BEG FOR YOUR LIFE NOW!!" and "INTO THE POT ALREADY!!"  Other characters are shown reacting with shock and fear, indicated by speech bubbles like "WHAT THE...?" and "AAAH!!" and "BWAA-EAEAH!!!".  A large splash and flames are present, suggesting a boiling pot or other intense heat.  One character is seen fleeing amidst the chaos, possibly engulfed in flames. The overall scene is one of intense action and danger.
