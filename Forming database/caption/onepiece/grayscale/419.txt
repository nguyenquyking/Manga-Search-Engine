One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Black Leg Sanji is engaged in combat, taking a hit, and reacting with pain ("That Hurt!!").  A character identified as one of the Straw Hats is attacked, shown being kicked ("Gagank," "Gank!!").  Another character, Butsu Yuna, is present, aiming to collect a bounty ("I'm gonna bag me a bounty!!!").  Sanji is shown putting on a battle suit ("Mwa ha ha!! Put on the battle suit already!!").  The scene is dynamic and action-packed, with sound effects and motion lines emphasizing the attacks and impact.
