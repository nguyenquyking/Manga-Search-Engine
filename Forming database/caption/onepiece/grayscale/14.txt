One Piece manga depicting a scene with multiple panels.  The first panel shows villagers releasing lanterns with messages "Please vanquish the scary dragon" and "Restore the Kozuki Clan."  Subsequent panels show a large, fiery dragon-like creature emerging from the ground.  Another panel features Kaido (implied by text referencing Joyboy and his defeat) and a large blue dragon, possibly a manifestation of the creature from earlier panels. There are speech bubbles indicating characters' surprise and thoughts about Joyboy. The final panel shows Kaido confidently stating that someone will one day defeat him.  The art style is reminiscent of the One Piece manga, with dynamic action lines and expressive character designs.
