One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Zoro (Zolo) is engaged in combat, deflecting a massive spiked ball attack from a large, monstrous opponent.  Other Straw Hat Pirates are present, reacting with alarm and urging caution ("Don't push it, you guys!").  The scene is chaotic, with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia highlighting the intensity of the fight.  The monster's attack is powerful and narrowly avoided.  The overall visual style is characteristic of the One Piece manga, emphasizing action and exaggerated expressions.
