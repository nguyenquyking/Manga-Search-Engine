One Piece manga scene depicting a large gorilla, Briscola, an Animal Kingdom Pirates Headliner with the Gorilla Smile Fruit, confronting other characters.  Briscola is shown powerfully attacking, with speech bubbles indicating his aggression ("You won't get past me!!", "Prepare for a beat-down!!!").  Other characters react with fear and surprise ("Why is the gorilla growing out of there?!").  The scene shows a dynamic action sequence with a focus on Briscola's overwhelming size and strength.  Another character, seemingly allied with Briscola, is seen attacking earlier in the panel.
