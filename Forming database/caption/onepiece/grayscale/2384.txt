One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A large, obese Yokozuna (sumo wrestler) is shown laughing maniacally, his actions suggesting he's about to attack a smaller female samurai, Okiiku.  Okiiku is wielding a katana. Another character, seemingly Luffy, observes with excitement, commenting on the scene's intensity.  The Yokozuna asserts his dominance over the commoners,  while Okiiku remains defiant.  The scene is set in a seemingly formal or high-class setting, judging by the attire and the Yokozuna's status.  The overall tone is one of conflict and impending violence.
