One Piece manga panel depicting Sanji, a chef, reacting to a skeptical older man's doubt about his cooking skills.  The older man questions Sanji's ability to handle Dragon Salmon, a challenging ingredient, implying only a top-tier chef would attempt it. Sanji, smirking and adjusting his tie, is unfazed and even more motivated by the challenge. The scene includes speech bubbles highlighting the verbal exchange and Sanji's internal thoughts.  The background shows a simple kitchen setting.
