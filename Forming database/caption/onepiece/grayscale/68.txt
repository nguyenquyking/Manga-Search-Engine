One Piece manga panel depicting a fight between two female characters. One, with short hair, in a black leather-like outfit, uses water to counter the other's attack.

The short-haired character states she can wash away the soap and its effects with water, while the longer-haired character is shown reacting negatively to this. The longer-haired character is also shown to be underestimated by her opponent.  The scene is dynamic, showing impact and motion lines indicating the force of the water and the attack.
