One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene in an amusement park.  A character, possibly a chef or food-based antagonist, activates a "flavor bomb," causing a large explosion.  Another character, appearing slender and dark-clad, wields a scythe-like weapon amidst the blast.  A third character is thrown backward by the force of the explosion. The scene is filled with onomatopoeia like "CH-CHING!", "KABLABLA BLAM," and musical notes, emphasizing the explosive and dramatic nature of the event.  The style is consistent with the One Piece manga art.
