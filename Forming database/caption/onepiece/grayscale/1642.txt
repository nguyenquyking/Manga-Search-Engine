One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where Kin'emon, a thug from the capital, confronts and defeats another character (unidentified, possibly a boar). Kin'emon, shirtless and wearing a fundoshi (loincloth), laughs triumphantly after incapacitating his opponent, having gained valuable information about a platinum-worth boar. Another character is seen in the lower panel, possibly a subordinate of the Kurokoma boss, awaiting a handover of something.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia emphasizing the violence and the victor's glee.
