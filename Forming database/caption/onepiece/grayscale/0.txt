One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Luffy, visibly strained, is shown reacting to a powerful, destructive force emanating from a monstrous, vaguely serpentine entity.  The entity is depicted with swirling, fiery tendrils and emits intense energy.  Luffy's expression shows pain and exertion.  Text bubbles indicate Luffy's effort ("You fought hard to reach this point!!") and his inability to change the world's course.  The scene is chaotic and suggestive of a climactic battle.
