One Piece manga panel depicting a young Luffy, possibly in his teenage years, experiencing a pivotal moment.  He's shown in various scenes: initially on a boat, gazing at the sea; then a close-up of his determined face; and lastly, encountering a muscular older man, possibly his father, who looks surprised.  The text indicates this is a non-canon story arc where Luffy is aiming to become the Pirate King at age 15.  Visual elements include a boat, seagulls, and a large fish. The scene transitions from Luffy's solitude to an interaction with a possibly significant adult figure.
