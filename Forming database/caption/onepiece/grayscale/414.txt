Black and white illustration from Toriyama Sekien's "Konjaku Hyakki Shui" depicting the demon Kazenbo.  Kazenbo, a beggar bonze (Buddhist teacher), is engulfed in flames and smoke near a tree.  The image shows the demon's skeletal form amidst fire, suggesting its fiery demise.  The scene is set in a landscape with mushrooms, possibly representing the old burial ground in Mt. Toribe, Kyoto.
