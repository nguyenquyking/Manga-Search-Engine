One Piece manga scene depicting a battle in the Right Brain Tower, center hallway. Ulti (with horns) unleashes a powerful attack, while a character, possibly Page One, is shown being hit. Another character, possibly Nami, is seen reacting to the attack.  A third character, possibly Sanji, calls out to another, saying "Young Master".  The scene is chaotic and dynamic, showing the intensity of the fight with impact and motion lines. The background shows the architectural details of the tower.  The panel also features text indicating the location and the characters' actions and dialogue.
