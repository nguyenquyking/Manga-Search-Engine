One Piece manga panel depicting a family on a boat.  A father and son, possibly Luffy and his father, are shown leaving on a boat, with the father seemingly embracing the pirate life.  Another panel shows a girl, possibly Nami, holding a small stuffed animal, and a boy wearing a jersey with the number 56, seemingly celebrating. A final panel shows the family, along with other characters, joyfully singing the Family song.  The overall scene is lighthearted and celebratory.
