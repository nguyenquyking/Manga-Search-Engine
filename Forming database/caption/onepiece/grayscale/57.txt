One Piece manga panel depicting a female character, likely a subordinate of Sanji, struggling against a powerful attack. She is drenched in water, unable to maintain her footing or grip on her Clima-Tact.  The attack is referred to as "Golden Awa," a technique seemingly causing slippery conditions.  Other characters are not clearly visible, but the scene implies a chaotic and urgent evacuation is underway.  The character's expressions and dialogue convey distress and panic.
