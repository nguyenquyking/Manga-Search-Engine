One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A character with long hair, possibly a Straw Hat, uses a power called "Straw-Straw" to merge with subordinates' spirits, becoming invulnerable.  This character is facing off against what appears to be two or more Worst Generation members.  One of these opponents is large and imposing, possibly a Strawman, initiating a "game" using "Strawman Cards."  Other characters, including Zoro and possibly other Straw Hats, are present, witnessing the unfolding events with expressions of surprise and concern.  The overall scene is dramatic and action-packed, set against a desolate landscape.
