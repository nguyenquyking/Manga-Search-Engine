One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A distraught, long-haired male character, possibly the protagonist,  is shown reacting to betrayal. He is seen clutching his head, with text bubbles expressing his regret and self-blame ("I should have known I was going to be let down"). Another male character, with a hat, looks on.  A third character, seemingly smaller and possibly female, is shown earlier in a separate panel, possibly being attacked or fleeing.  A fourth character, who appears to be the betrayer, is shown in a panel expressing a sense of victory ("I had all of my hopes and dreams"). The setting is a rainy, rocky landscape.  The overall mood is intense, highlighting themes of betrayal, regret, and loss.
