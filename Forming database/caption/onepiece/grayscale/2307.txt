One Piece manga panel depicting a celebratory scene following a successful treasure barge acquisition.  A large crowd joyfully celebrates, with various villagers expressing gratitude.  Luffy, visibly pleased, is shown in several panels, reacting to the scene and conversing with Trafalgar Law, who expresses his characteristically cynical disapproval of the pirates' benevolent actions.  The villagers' expressions range from elation to tearful joy.  The overall tone is one of festive celebration contrasted with Law's sardonic commentary.
