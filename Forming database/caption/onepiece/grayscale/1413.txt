One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of intense action and emotional turmoil.  Momonosuke, visibly distressed, is urged to stop by Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, Kiku, Kawamatsu, Dogstorm, and Ashura, who are attempting to prevent what appears to be a suicidal act.  A large group of warriors, numbering 4200,  are shown previously assembling for a raid on Onigashima during the Fire Festival, their efforts described as not in vain.  The overall mood is dramatic and urgent, set against a backdrop of stormy seas and ravaged terrain.
