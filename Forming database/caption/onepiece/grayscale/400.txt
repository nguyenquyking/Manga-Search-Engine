One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation within a cave chamber.  Several large, monstrous figures, seemingly affiliated with Kaido, are present, along with several key characters.  Inbi, Fuga, and Zanki are prominently displayed as names within the numbered panels.  A discussion ensues regarding allegiance and a forthcoming battle.  The scene suggests a power struggle; one character speculates on whether the opposing force is a Navy spy, while another declares that only the outcome of the battle matters.  The overall tone is one of impending conflict and high stakes.
