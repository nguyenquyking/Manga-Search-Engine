One Piece manga scene depicting a Sumo-style battle.  A large, sumo-wrestler-like character explains the rules: failure results in instant death; victory allows joining his pirate crew.  Luffy, freed from sea prism stone cuffs by the large character, is surprised to find a more dangerous item placed upon him instead.  The large character is amused by Luffy's reaction.  The scene highlights Luffy's liberation and subsequent deception, along with the antagonist's overwhelming advantage in manpower and weapons.
