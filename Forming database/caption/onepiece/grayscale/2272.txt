Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  Luffy, exhibiting a determined grin, uses his Gum-Gum powers against a massive, dragon-like creature.  The scene depicts a powerful impact, with the onomatopoeia "BA" and "GUN!!!" emphasizing the force.  Other panels show onlookers reacting to the attack, with one panel indicating that the creature is an Elephant.  The Straw Hats are clearly involved in the confrontation.
