One Piece manga panel depicting reactions to Sabo's survival.  Three characters react with shock and disbelief to the news, one exclaiming "Sabo!!!" Another panel shows a chained figure, likely in Impel Down, laughing maniacally.  A third panel features Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard) commanding his crew to prepare for departure from Pirate Island, Fullalead.  The overall scene conveys the ramifications of Sabo's reappearance and Blackbeard's opportunistic actions.
