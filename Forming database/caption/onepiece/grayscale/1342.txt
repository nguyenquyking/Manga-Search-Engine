One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  A character, possibly a lookout, observes a distant location, noting it's further than expected.  Another scene shows several characters reacting to the sight of numerous ships.  One character, seemingly surprised, exclaims about the ships.  In a separate panel, two female characters are drinking.  Another panel shows a group of people seemingly asleep, deemed as "no problem" by an observing character.  Finally, a surprised character shouts "Sleep-Grass Star!!"  The overall scene suggests an infiltration or approach to Kaido's castle.
