One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle. A woman with long dark hair, wearing a striped kimono with flower patterns, is seen powerfully attacking a man with long dark hair.  The man is being sliced and is clearly defeated, with debris flying around him.  In the background, other onlookers react with shock, observing the results of a contest or fight. Text bubbles indicate the woman's overwhelming strength ("Even if sliced to bits...") and the observers' reactions ("That guy's a monster!", "The results are clear!", "I could never complain"). The scene is dynamic and emphasizes the woman's superior fighting prowess.
