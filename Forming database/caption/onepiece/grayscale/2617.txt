A character, seemingly Luffy, is shown inside Wada-tsumi's mouth, along with another character, possibly Zoro, expressing confusion about their location.  Wada-tsumi, in the lower panel, is shown underwater, attempting to capture a fleeing fish-like creature while bubbles and motion lines illustrate the water's movement.  Text indicates torpedoes and the urgency of the situation.
