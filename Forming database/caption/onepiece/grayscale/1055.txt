One Piece manga scene depicting a powerful attack.  Yamato, visibly distressed, cries out, "Your words brought tears to my eyes!!"  Another character, possibly a subordinate or onlooker, reacts with surprise ("Huh...?").  A flashback shows a scene with Kozuki Oden, possibly his death or a significant moment in his life, indicated by the text "The life of Kozuki Oden...".  Yamato unleashes a massive, explosive attack ("DADADADADOOM"), targeting an opponent who cries out in pain ("AAAAH!!!"). The visual style is highly dynamic, emphasizing the power of the attack with onomatopoeia and motion lines.
