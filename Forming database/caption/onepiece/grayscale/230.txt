One Piece manga scene depicting Kaido's massive form high above, unleashing an attack.  Big Mom, visibly tired, orders Hera to take her to the rooftop to confront Luffy.  Another panel shows an exhausted Big Mom,  and a separate panel shows a character (likely Luffy) preparing an attack with a sword.  The scene is chaotic, showing the destructive power of Kaido's attack and the determination of Big Mom to continue the fight.  The overall tone is one of intense battle and impending climax.
