One Piece manga panel depicting a frantic chase scene.  A character, seemingly Franky, experiences his Franken-sword breaking ("My Franken-sword snapped!!"). He's pursued by another character (possibly Luffy, though not explicitly named)  who is shown escaping in a vehicle, with Franky attempting to stop him.  The panels show the pursuing character's vehicle being damaged. Franky's frustration is evident ("The performance floor is just ahead!! Can't let him get in there!!").  The pursued character is described as running away shamefully.  The scene culminates with Franky deploying a "Gaon Cannon, Portable Version" and a "Bulle-Tricer-atops" attack.  The style is dynamic, with many motion lines and onomatopoeia indicating speed and impact.
