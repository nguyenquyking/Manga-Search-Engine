Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  Dracule Mihawk, the world's greatest swordsman, looms large, introducing himself.  Below, Roronoa Zoro lies injured on a ship's deck amidst broken wood, while his crewmates tend to his wounds. Mihawk advises Zoro to "know thyself" and "know thy world" as a path to becoming stronger.  The scene emphasizes Mihawk's power and Zoro's need for growth.
