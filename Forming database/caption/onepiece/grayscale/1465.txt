One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A powerful, chained figure (likely a prisoner) is shown engulfed in flames and energy, screaming "AAAAHHHH!!!"  Another character, seemingly a subordinate, is thrown into the water, with the text "BLOOSH!" indicating the impact.  In a separate panel, other characters are shown reacting;  one is concerned, urging others not to let "our lord" go alone. Another panel shows a group of onlookers discussing the situation, one stating they have errands to run, while another notes the stubbornness of the chained figure.  The overall mood is intense and action-packed, focusing on a powerful moment of struggle and sacrifice.
