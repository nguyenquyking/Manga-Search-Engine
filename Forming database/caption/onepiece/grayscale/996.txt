One Piece manga panel depicting Ulti and Page One, two Tobiroppo, battling outside the Onigashima dome.  Ulti, a woman with a dragon-dragon fruit (Pachycephalosaurus model), is shown mid-battle. Page One, also with a dragon-dragon fruit (Spinosaurus model), is fighting alongside her.  A separate panel shows a flashback with a destroyed dragon statue and a narrator explaining its history and connection to a character's deceased father. Another panel shows a close-up of Ulti's determined face as she prepares to attack.  The scene is chaotic, with debris and shattered stone surrounding the combatants.
