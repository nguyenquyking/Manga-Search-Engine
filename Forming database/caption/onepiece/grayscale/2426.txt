One Piece manga panel depicting the aftermath of X. Drake's attack on Amigasa village in Wano.  The village, once known for its woven hats, is now largely destroyed. Only two villagers remain, highlighting the devastation caused by Kaido's forces.  The panel contrasts the ruined countryside with the flourishing Flower Capital, the shogun Orochi's residence.  A close-up shows a large, scowling figure, possibly Orochi himself.
