One Piece manga scene:  A female character, possibly a pirate captain, confronts a crowd of armed townsfolk. She's centrally positioned, dramatically posed in a long dark coat and top hat, wielding a long staff.  The townspeople are brandishing sticks and appear fearful.  Text bubbles indicate she offers them a choice: fight or die.  Two other characters, Lind and Karasu, are ordered to provide backup. The scene is tense and action-oriented.
