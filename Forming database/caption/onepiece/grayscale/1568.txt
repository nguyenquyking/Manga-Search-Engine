One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation revealing the death of the previous Kozuki Shogun.  The scene shows two characters: one with long, flowing hair, expressing shock and disbelief at the news of their grandfather's death, and another character narrating the events. The narrative reveals the Shogun's death was at the hands of the Kozuki clan, and that his death was not due to a crime, but rather a power struggle. The panel also shows silhouettes of the five Daimyo clans who served the Kozuki, highlighting their unrest.  The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga, utilizing speech bubbles and dramatic expressions to convey the story.
