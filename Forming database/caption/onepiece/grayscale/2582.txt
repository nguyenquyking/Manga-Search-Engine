One Piece manga scene depicting a naval battle.  The *Prodence* ship is under attack.  A large explosion engulfs the ship's bow.  A figure wearing a checkered cape and crown (likely a commander or admiral) orders cannons prepared, reacting to the enemy attack. Another figure, possibly a subordinate, shouts "Yessir!!"  The scene is chaotic, with explosions, water splashes, and onomatopoeia emphasizing the intensity of the attack.
