Another character, possibly Zoro, is shown injured, being carried away while others urge them to flee, shouting "They spotted us! Run faster!!".  The scene highlights intense action and the desperate escape of injured allies.  Text boxes indicate Zoro's injuries and the urgency of the situation, with one character stating "I'm not done with you." and another urging the protection of Zoro.
