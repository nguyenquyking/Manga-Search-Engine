One Piece manga scene depicting a chaotic beach battle.  Luffy observes a massive creature, possibly a sea king, violently attacking someone.  Another panel shows a commanding figure, likely an antagonist, ordering a subordinate (possibly a baboon) to capture Luffy, emphasizing the need to kill Luffy regardless of the consequences.  The scene is highly dynamic, characterized by splashing water, intense expressions, and onomatopoeia representing impact and struggle.  The visual elements suggest a significant power disparity between the combatants.
