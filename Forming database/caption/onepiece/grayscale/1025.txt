One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character, possibly Luffy,  is using a large club to strike a heavily armored opponent, possibly Kaido. The impact creates large shockwaves. The scene is dynamic, showing multiple panels of the attack and the subsequent effects on the opponent who is visibly recoiling from the blows.  The final panel shows the aftermath of the attack, with the opponent seemingly falling or collapsing.  Onomatopoeia throughout the panels emphasize the force of the blows ("GANK!!," "THUD!!," "WHAM!!," "SHUNK!!").
