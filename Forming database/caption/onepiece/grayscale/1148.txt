One Piece manga panel depicting Kaido's reaction to the commotion at Onigashima.  Kaido, shown in a large panel above, observes the chaos.  Below, Sasaki and other characters express their regret at being captured, unaware of Kyoshiro's true allegiance as one of Oden's vassals.  Another panel shows Kaido drinking and wondering about the noise, while another reveals the source of the commotion and the escape of a character (likely from the battle).  The visual elements include Onigashima, large waves, and expressions of shock and remorse.
