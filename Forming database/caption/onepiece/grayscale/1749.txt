One Piece Chapter 954:  Gang Bege's Oh My Family ship, prominently displaying "BEGE" and "FAMILY" on its sails, navigates turbulent waters.  The ship is shown sailing near a large, imposing cliff face, possibly the Red Line.  Other ships are visible in the background, suggesting a large fleet or chaotic scene.  The title, "Like a Dragon Given Wings," alludes to the ship's progress despite the challenging conditions.
