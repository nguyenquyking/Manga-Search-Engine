One Piece manga panel depicting a naval battle.  Multiple ships are shown engaged in combat, with figures shouting "Sunacchi!!!" and "Raaaaah!!".  A character, possibly a captain, is shown in the lower right panel, appearing distressed with tears streaming down his face.  The scene suggests a flashback to the characters' younger days, with dialogue boxes referencing their past and a discussion about courage and risk-taking.  The overall tone is intense and action-oriented.
