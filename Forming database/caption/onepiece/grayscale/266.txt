One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  A woman with dark hair, styled up, wearing a kimono, ponders a strategy while Brook (skeleton with afro and bow and arrow) and another character (large, possibly a giant) listen. The conversation centers on finding a way to surpass Paradise Farms in terms of taste, as they dominate flour quality.  A subsequent panel shows a character walking in a forest, contemplating unique flavor ingredients unavailable to Paradise Farms, highlighting a competitive food-related challenge.
