One Piece manga scene depicting a fierce battle.  Luffy, using his Gum-Gum abilities, confronts a massive, complex mechanical structure, possibly a cyborg or robot.  Law observes from a distance, his sword at the ready.  The scene is chaotic, with shattered rock and intense energy effects surrounding the combatants.  Luffy aims to deliver a "surgical death" by entering the machine's interior.  The mechanical structure is depicted as monstrous, reinforcing Law's observation that they are "monsters in their own right."
