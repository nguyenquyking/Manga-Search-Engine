One Piece manga panel depicting a battle.  A large, pink-haired, red-clothed figure (likely a mink) uses a "Fang Pistol" attack, a pink energy blast, against a smaller, dark-purple-clothed opponent. The attack is shown striking the opponent in subsequent panels.  In earlier panels, flashbacks reveal a blue-skinned character, possibly Rob Lucci, reflecting on past events. The overall scene is dynamic and action-packed, showcasing the energy of a fierce battle.
