One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between Who's-Who (a large, muscular minik, wearing a red jacket and a belt with a symbol, his pink hair and horns are visible) and another character (a dark-skinned man in purple and gold robes).  Who's-Who is expressing disbelief about a past event, possibly involving a prison break by a CP9 agent. The background shows a previous scene of a CP9 agent escaping prison, using a powerful technique.  Text boxes detail the discussion about the Six Powers, a government-used fighting style.
