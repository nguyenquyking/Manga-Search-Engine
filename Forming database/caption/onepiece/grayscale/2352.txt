One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Roronoa Zoro's future depictions at ages 40 and 60.  At age 40, Zoro is shown with four swords, a more youthful appearance, and a text bubble indicating wounds.  At age 60, he's depicted with five swords and a more weathered look.  A third image at age 60 shows an alternate, impoverished Zoro begging for money.  The question and answer section discusses the change from beer mugs to barrels for alcoholic beverages in the manga.
