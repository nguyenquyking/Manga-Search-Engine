One Piece SBS Question Corner features fan questions and Oda's responses.  A fan asks how Mihawk, Crocodile, and Doflamingo would look using face-youngening apps. Oda shows chibi versions of the characters. Another fan asks why Kid and Killer don't use the "butt-breathing" technique to survive. Oda responds humorously.  A final question concerns Oda's use of katakana for tough-talking characters; Oda explains it's inspired by the manga *Akira*.  The image includes panels showing the three One Piece characters (Mihawk, Crocodile, Doflamingo) in their "younger" versions, chibi versions of Kid and Killer, and a panel showing the *Akira* manga cover.
