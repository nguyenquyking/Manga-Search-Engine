One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a small child looking at a ship in the distance, possibly the Going Merry.  The second panel shows a surprised Luffy and a shadowed Zoro.  The third features a smaller child near a wrecked ship and a cloaked figure. Luffy, seemingly from the wreck, calls out to someone.  The final panel shows two men looking up in awe as a third, unseen individual, raises a katana high into the air. The overall scene suggests a moment of reunion or rescue amidst a chaotic or damaged environment.
