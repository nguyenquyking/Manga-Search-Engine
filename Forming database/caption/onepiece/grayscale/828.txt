One Piece manga panel depicting Miss Black Maria, her subordinates, and Luffy.  Black Maria expresses anger and frustration, stating her love is exclusive and threatening those who defy her. Luffy, seemingly overwhelmed but defiant, counters with his own declaration of love for all women and expresses concern about damaging Black Maria's fist.  Other characters are shown reacting to the scene's unfolding events.  The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga's characteristic line art and speech bubbles.
