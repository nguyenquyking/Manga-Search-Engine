One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A samurai uses "Foxfire Style" to unleash a "Flame-Rend" attack, creating a large explosion.  Simultaneously, a monstrous creature, possibly a dragon, counters with a "Blast Breath."  Other samurai, presumably Lord Oden's, stand defiant amidst the chaos, declaring their willingness to die rather than flee. The creature scoffs at the idea of them running.  The visual elements include dramatic action lines, onomatopoeia ("BOOOM," "SHANK," "SLICE"), and intense facial expressions reflecting the characters' determination and the gravity of the situation.
