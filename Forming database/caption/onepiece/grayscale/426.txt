One Piece manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  Two characters, one with long blonde hair (likely Eustass Kid) and another wearing a mask with vertical stripes (likely a member of the Blackbeard Pirates), engage in a heated dialogue.  Kid explains his power redirects damage taken to another person. The masked character expresses concern about taking damage without a proper conduit.  The scene is set outdoors, possibly in a town, with background buildings visible.  The overall mood is serious and confrontational.
