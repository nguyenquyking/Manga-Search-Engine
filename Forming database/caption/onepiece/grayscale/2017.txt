One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Akainu (Sakazuki) and Rob Lucci.  The first question concerns Akainu's comment to Lucci about being a "Mr. Pervert" in *One Piece Film: Gold*, explained as Lucci printing suggestive pictures.  The second question asks about cylindrical Transponder Snails in Wano, answered as Light-Scroll Snails, a Wano-specific communication method similar to, but weaker than, standard Transponder Snails.  Images include Akainu smoking a cigar and a close-up of Lucci.  Illustrations of the Light-Scroll Snails are also shown.
