One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blonde-haired character is launched backwards by a powerful force, possibly an attack.  Another character, a dark, armored figure with wings, is shown in the background.  A large explosion is depicted, seemingly causing significant destruction to a building.  In the lower panel, a large, angry, scarred character with a cross-shaped marking on his face is present. He is reacting to an attack, possibly from a mechanical bird-like device shown partially in the lower right panel.  The text "Stupid Cocky Birdman..." is present as a speech bubble from the large character.  The scene implies a fierce confrontation with significant damage inflicted.
