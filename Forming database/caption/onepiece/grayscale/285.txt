One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a character, seemingly a chef, is overwhelmed with excitement upon seeing a wanted poster of Sanji.  He is shown muttering to himself about Sanji's appearance ("gorgeous golden locks, swirling eyebrows") and his admiration for him. Other characters are present, reacting with expressions of confusion or amusement to the chef's behavior. One character addresses the others as "craven scoundrels," implying a hierarchical dynamic.  Sanji's wanted poster is prominently displayed, featuring his characteristic features and the nickname "Big Bro Sanji."
