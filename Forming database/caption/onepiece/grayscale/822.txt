One Piece manga panel depicting a tense scene.  Sanji, visibly injured and bleeding from the mouth, is shown in the bottom right panel.  In the central panel, Yamato, riding a black spider-like creature, engages in combat.  Yamato is urging someone to call Nico Robin.  The top panels show Sanji's struggle, possibly against Yamato's attack.  The overall scene suggests a battle with urgent communication needed to call for backup.
