One Piece Chapter 1036:  Kaido, falling from the sky with large black wings, is shown in a panel depicting a powerful impact.  Another panel shows Zoro fighting, breathing heavily, seemingly mid-battle. King is shown in a close-up, surprised, questioning Kaido's state.  The chapter title, "Bushido Is The Way Of Death," emphasizes the samurai-like fighting style and high stakes.
