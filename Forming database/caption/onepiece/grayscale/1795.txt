One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Luffy in chibi style and a Q&A section.  Luffy is depicted in Wano-style clothing.  The Q&A section addresses questions about Wano clothing, Oda's fan mail habits, and Hyogoro's hair resembling komainu and koma deer, concluding he's a "koma human".  The final question concerns Imu's light erasing history, to which Oda assures the reader not to worry.  Several illustrations accompany the text, including drawings of fundoshi and yumoji undergarments, Hyogoro, komainu, a koma deer, and a group of unnamed individuals possibly facing erasure from history.
