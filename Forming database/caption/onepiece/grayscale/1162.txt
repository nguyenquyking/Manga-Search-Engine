One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic battle scene.  A masked character, possibly a pirate, pleads to fight alongside Luffy ("Please let me fight on your side!!"), stating he is now a "one-man army."  Simultaneously, a massive figure, possibly Kaido, unleashes a powerful attack, "Kong Gun!!", while another character, seemingly Drake, uses "Calibur!!!" in a separate attack.  Other characters react with surprise and concern, with one observing Drake's involvement ("That's Drake from the Tobi Roppo!!").  The overall scene is chaotic and filled with action lines and impact effects, suggesting a significant clash during a major battle.
