One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce sword fight.  The top panel shows a character (likely Zoro) with a determined expression, wielding a katana, in a downward striking motion.  The middle panel displays a dynamic clash between two characters; one is sent flying backward after a powerful attack. The bottom panel shows a character (possibly Zoro again) reacting to a blow. The scene is full of motion lines emphasizing the speed and intensity of the sword fight.  The word "ONIGIRI!!!" is present in a speech bubble, possibly a battle cry. "WHA..." is in the bottom panel, suggesting surprise or impact.  The art style is characteristic of One Piece manga, with exaggerated expressions and dynamic action lines.
