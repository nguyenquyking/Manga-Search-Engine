One Piece manga panel depicting X. Drake, a Navy HQ top secret special force captain of "SWORD", reacting with surprise ("Huh?!", "What?!").  Koby, a Navy HQ captain and member of "SWORD", expresses concern about implications of Drake's news.  The scene shows Drake and Koby's reactions to the news of an unknown event in Wano, with Drake having seen a Cipher Pol agent (CPO).  The overall tone suggests a significant development in the storyline.  A separate panel shows a figure, possibly Luffy, in a damaged room, indicating a stagnant situation.
