Dr. Stone spin-off manga depicting Senku's alternate reality as a pirate.  The scene shows Senku and his crew on a pirate ship, encountering a giant, mechanized creature.  Other panels show Senku's crew reacting to the ship's appearance, and a final panel shows Senku with his crewmates, discussing their plan to obtain a large amount of minerals to build a rocket to the moon.  The style is comedic, emphasizing the absurdity of Senku's situation.  A dinosaur is also visible in one panel.
