One Piece manga panel depicting several scenes.  Panel 1 shows bruised and bloodied Akazaaya samurai escaping through the roof. Panel 2 shows a character, possibly Orochi, stating they are occupied and asking if anyone else is present.  The Akazaaya samurai escaped from Kaido and are on the second floor of the treasure repository. Panel 3 shows Kin'emon urgently trying to stop someone (possibly Yamato) who intends to go and finish off the Akazaaya,  while Black Maria's presence is noted.  The instruction is to proceed to the treasure room immediately and kill all the samurai.
