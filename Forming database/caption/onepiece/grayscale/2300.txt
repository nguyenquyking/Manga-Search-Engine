One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  A young girl expresses shock at the mention of her mother.  Older men, including what appears to be a large, round-faced man, discuss a plan involving the Kozuki clan's revenge,  20 years in the making, and the reactivation of dormant allies marked with a moon symbol on their ankles.  A stern-faced man with swords vows to proceed despite the risk. The scene centers on the revelation of a secret alliance and the impending confrontation with Orochi.  Characters present include  Lady Toki (mentioned), a young girl (possibly her daughter), and several older men who appear to be samurai.
