One Piece manga panel depicting two characters, one blonde and the other dark-haired, on a rain-swept beach. The blonde character, wielding a large club, confronts the dark-haired character.  Both are dressed in dark clothing.  The scene shows an accusatory interaction, with dialogue bubbles suggesting the food on a nearby ship has been tampered with, and that the two are the only ones on the island.  A third panel shows a close-up of the blonde character's aggressive expression.  The final panel shows a struggle between the two characters.  The overall mood is tense and suspicious.
