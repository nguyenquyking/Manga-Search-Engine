One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Hyogoro, engulfed in flames, is engaged in combat with another character wielding a katana.  Other pirates are present, some shouting words of encouragement or warning.  One panel shows a character  (likely Hyogoro's subordinate) telling Hyogoro not to rush. Another panel shows Hyogoro's allies urging him to leave.  The overall scene is chaotic and intense, with several speech bubbles indicating dialogue and sound effects. The antagonist is planning an escape using antibodies.
