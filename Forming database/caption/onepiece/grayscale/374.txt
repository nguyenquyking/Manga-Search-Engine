One Piece manga scene depicting a battle. A large, winged, dark-colored figure wielding a long weapon attacks, creating a large explosion.  A smaller figure, possibly a swordsman, observes, speculating about the opponent's race ("fish-man? giant blood?"). The larger figure is then shown impacting the ground, causing a significant impact. Another panel shows the smaller figure, possibly Zoro, heavily breathing, determined to defeat the opponent. The sound of a shamisen is noted, adding to the mystery. The scene is set in a rocky, mountainous landscape.
