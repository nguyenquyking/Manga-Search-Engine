A dramatic One Piece manga panel depicting a fiery confrontation.  Two towering figures, seemingly commanders of the Beast Pirates, dominate the scene.  On the left, a dark-clothed figure with large, dark wings and burning, demonic features is engulfed in flames, yelling "GYAAH!!!".  On the right, a large, yellow-skinned figure with a horse-like head and intricate clothing, is also surrounded by fire, issuing a threat: "LISTEN UP, YOU TREACHEROUS SCUM...".  Both are threatening a group of smaller, engulfed figures below them, who are reacting in fear.  The text bubbles indicate the antagonists are retaliating against those who turned their backs on the Beast Pirates. The overall scene is chaotic and intensely violent, filled with flames and expressions of fear and anger.
