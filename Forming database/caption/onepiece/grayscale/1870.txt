One Piece manga scene depicting Luffy's triumphant declaration of control over Udon prison.  Luffy, grinning broadly and flexing his arms, proclaims "And now this place is mine,"  and "I've always been free."  In the background, reports indicate Udon is isolated, the opera house is non-operational, and gates are checked, suggesting a successful takeover. Another panel shows a concerned individual reacting to Luffy's actions.  The overall visual style is dynamic, emphasizing Luffy's power and freedom.
