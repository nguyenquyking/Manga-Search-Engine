One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of chaos and apology.  A fox-like creature, possibly a mink, repeatedly apologizes ("Forgive me!! I know!!!"; "Forgive me.") while surrounded by numerous swords falling into a snow-like substance.  Another mink-like figure, possibly a different character or the same one in a different pose, is seen reacting with exclamations ("Yip!", "Yiiiip!", "Grrrr!!!"). The background shows a damaged building, suggestive of a recent battle.  The sound effect "Shuk" is repeatedly used, implying the sound of swords clashing or falling.  The overall tone is one of remorse and aftermath.
