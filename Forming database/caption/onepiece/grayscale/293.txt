One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a conversation between a dark-cloaked figure and Shanks. Shanks is reclining, holding a drink, and appears amused. The dark figure is resolute, stating their life belongs to Shanks.  The second panel shows a swordsman, likely Zoro, heavily straining during a fight. The third panel depicts a confident blonde character, possibly Mihawk, declaring he won't lose. The final panel shows Luffy reacting to a powerful attack; a defeated character is shown in the foreground.  The dialogue strongly suggests themes of rivalry, ambition, and Luffy's path to becoming King of the Pirates.
