One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy and other characters.  Luffy's power draws people to him, but when he's an enemy, he's unreachable.  A discussion between Luffy and another character (possibly Zoro) ensues, with the latter warning Luffy against reckless actions at a crucial moment.  Another character, possibly Hawkins, is shown as having previously allied with Kaido.  The scene is intense, with sword clashes and dialogue boxes expressing determination and caution.
