One Piece manga panel depicting Red-Haired Shanks' rage directed at Luffy.  Shanks, enraged, explains his grudge isn't directly against Luffy but against the man who stole the Gum-Gum fruit, which Luffy inherited.  The scene shows Shanks' attack, a powerful "Fang Pistol," impacting the ground.  Another panel shows an older character (possibly a flashback) wielding a weapon.  The visual elements include onomatopoeia representing the force of Shanks' attack and the destruction it causes.
