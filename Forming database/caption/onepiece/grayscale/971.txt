One Piece manga scene depicting a chaotic battle scene in a Japanese-style city.  Luffy, visibly distressed, calls out "Father?".  Yamato, Kaido's daughter, explains her father and his men are on an expedition, confirming the absence of officers.  Another panel shows a widespread destruction with fires and fallen combatants, suggesting a large-scale conflict.  A character (possibly Zoro) urges an end to the violence.  The overall scene emphasizes conflict, familial connections (Luffy and Yamato's interaction), and widespread destruction.
