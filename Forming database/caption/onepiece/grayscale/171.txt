One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle between Luffy and a dragon-like figure. Luffy, in Gear Fourth, is unleashing a powerful attack, "Supreme Kong Gun," against the opponent.  The opponent, possibly a member of the CP0, is described as weak or content to die for honor, while Luffy counters that samurai are strong and winners don't need justifications.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines, explosions, and intense expressions from both combatants.  The panel includes text boxes with dialogue revealing the characters' thoughts and motivations.
