A manga panel depicting a group of characters, primarily focused on a child pirate captain excitedly exclaiming "I've spotted land!"  Other characters react with varying degrees of amusement and exasperation.  The child captain, wearing a pirate hat with a dolphin skull and crossbones, is the central figure.  Secondary characters include a group of individuals seemingly commenting on the captain's antics, and a man possibly associated with the pirates, reacting to a dolphin playfully interacting with a person's hand.  The scene takes place on a ship at sea, transitioning to a land view.  The overall tone is lighthearted and comedic.
