One Piece manga, Vol. 93:  A large, round-faced character with a skull-and-crossbones hat, possibly Big Mom, experiences disorientation, expressing confusion with "Am I?" and "Who...?"  Another character, possibly a smaller member of her crew, reacts with surprise ("Huh?", "???").  The scene suggests a sudden and unexpected event, possibly a battle or escape, as indicated by speech bubbles like "Too late! We gotta run!". The overall mood is one of chaos and urgency.
