One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation between two swordsmen.  A heavily tattooed swordsman with a wide-brimmed hat, possibly a pirate captain, holds a small knife, derisively commenting on his opponent's skills.  His opponent, a younger, less decorated swordsman, is shown with a more aggressive stance, challenging the first swordsman.  The scene highlights the geographical context of East Blue and mentions the Grand Line.  The dialogue emphasizes the disparity in their perceived fighting abilities.
