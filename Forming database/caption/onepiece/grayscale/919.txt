Two mermaids are depicted in an underwater scene.  One mermaid, with long flowing hair, is prominently featured, wearing a pearl necklace and flowing, revealing attire. She is described as "so beautiful".  Another mermaid, positioned to the left and slightly behind, has her hair pulled back. A male merman is visible in the background, appearing less prominent. The scene is filled with bubbles and coral, enhancing the underwater setting. Text overlay reads "No art can do it justice!".
