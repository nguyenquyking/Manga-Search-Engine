One Piece manga scene depicting a large-scale battle and a celebratory gathering.  Luffy and his crew are shown in multiple panels, facing imminent danger and reflecting on their goals ("to build a place of happiness").  A large explosion is occurring near a significant building, possibly a castle. Big Mom is seen in a separate panel, happily enjoying a cake with her children, expressing excitement about the reunion and the cake's richness.  The panels show contrasting moods:  danger and impending conflict versus joyful celebration.
