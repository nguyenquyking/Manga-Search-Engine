One Piece manga panel depicting the aftermath of Gold Roger's execution.  The first panel shows Roger's ship, the Oro Jackson, sailing on the sea, with speech bubbles indicating the vast treasure and fame he accumulated, attracting many to seek it ("the One Piece"). Subsequent panels show various pirates reacting to this news: some plan to steal Roger's treasure, others to find and defeat him.  A final panel shows a group of pirates, possibly Roger's crew, expressing their emotional gratitude and reflecting on their journey.  The overall scene portrays the legacy and impact of Gold Roger on the One Piece world.
