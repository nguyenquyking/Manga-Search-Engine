One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blonde-haired character, possibly Diables (text bubble indicates "DIABLE"), uses a water-based attack ("...EAU ROTATION!") striking a dark-haired opponent. The opponent, whose name is not visible, displays a shocked and pained expression ("WHA-AAT?!").  The attack is shown as a rapid, swirling motion with water or energy effects.  The style is dynamic, emphasizing the speed and force of the attack.
