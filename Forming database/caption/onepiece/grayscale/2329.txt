One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation between Trafalgar Law and an unnamed Wano Country samurai.  Law, in his signature attire, claims he is a doctor and denies murder as his style, revealing he encountered the Straw Hats earlier.  The samurai, welcoming Law to Wano, questions his presence, noting his alliance's presence in the country and referencing the Sabaody Archipelago incident.  A panel shows panicked reports of Master Jack's defeat and the brigands' escape. A snail-like den den mushi is shown clicking, indicating communication.
