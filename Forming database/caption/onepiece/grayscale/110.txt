One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly a devil fruit user, is encased within a rapidly spinning, dragon-shaped Jump Rope attack.  The character yells "GAAAAH!!!". Another panel shows a "Blast Breath!!!" attack being launched, with a character reacting with "KAH!!". A third panel shows an object, possibly a skull-like creature, being launched by a projectile, with the sound effect "YEOWWW!!!".  The overall scene is dynamic and depicts multiple attacks during a fight.
