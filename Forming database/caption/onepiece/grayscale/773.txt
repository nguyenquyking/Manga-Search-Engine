One Piece manga panel depicting Zeus, a homunculus, falling into the sea after being struck.  Zeus cries out for help, while another character, seemingly Nami, observes the situation with concern.  The text indicates Zeus's distress and the futility of striking him. Another character, potentially a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, is shown reacting to the situation. The scene is chaotic, filled with motion lines suggesting a fall.  The final panel shows a to-be-continued notice.
