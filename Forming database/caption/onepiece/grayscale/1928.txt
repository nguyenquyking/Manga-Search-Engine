One Piece manga scene depicting reactions to an execution at Excavation Labor Camp, Udon.  Orochi, the former Daimyo, is shown laughing maniacally at the execution.  Other prisoners are also laughing hysterically, possibly due to the effects of Smile fruits.  A character (possibly Luffy) expresses disgust at the cruelty.  Lord Yasue's unexpected survival is noted.  The scene shows mass hysteria and the inhumane conditions of the prison camp.
