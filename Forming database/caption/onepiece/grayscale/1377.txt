One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Luffy smiles broadly, declaring "Cuz we're pals!!" to a crying, distressed child.  Other characters are shown arguing, with one saying "Cut him in two!!" while another responds about a "cowardly, dumb little brat".  Luffy's declaration is a contrast to the surrounding aggression.  A plan is formed to go to Onigashima, and a bird-like creature is depicted in flight. The overall scene shows contrasting emotions and impending action.
