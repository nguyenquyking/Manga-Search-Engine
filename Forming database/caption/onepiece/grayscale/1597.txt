One Piece manga scene depicting several characters reacting to monstrous creatures.  Three yokai-like creatures—a dog, a cat, and a river imp—are bound to stakes on a beach.  Villagers, possibly Wano Country residents, are present, expressing fear and anger. One villager states that the beach may be cursed.  A kappa, tied to a stake, proclaims its innocence.  Other panels show a boat at sea, indicating travel to Wano, with characters expressing surprise at the number of islands and hunger. The overall scene highlights the unexpected and dangerous nature of Wano.
