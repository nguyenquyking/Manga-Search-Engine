One Piece manga panel depicting a clandestine meeting.  A character explains a rebellion symbol—two fire birds over a pit viper, symbolizing the reversed crescent moon—to be distributed as flyers.  The symbol indicates the time and location of the uprising at Habu Port during the twilight second hour of the Fire Festival.  Another character confirms that those with a crescent moon mark on their left foot will understand. Zorojuro and Usohachi are in the capital to maximize reach, while comrades are spread throughout Wano.  A third character expresses skepticism about Zoro's involvement.
