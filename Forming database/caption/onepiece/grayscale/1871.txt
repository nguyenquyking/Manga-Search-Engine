One Piece SBS Question Corner features several panels.  The first shows two chibi-style characters, possibly representing Oda and Sanada, engaged in a humorous exchange.  A larger panel depicts a woman in a bathhouse, possibly Komurasaki, interacting with another character, referencing a bathhouse assistant's role.  Another panel shows Komurasaki in a more elegant setting. The text discusses Sanada's inappropriate behavior and the history of bathhouse assistants.  A final panel shows a stylized tree growing from a character's head, referencing a rakugo story, with Oda humorously stating the tree's origin.  The overall tone is comedic and suggestive.
