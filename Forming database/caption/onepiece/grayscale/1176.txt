One Piece manga panel depicting the Straw Hat Crew confronting a large group of enemies.  Luffy declares his intent to fight Kaido.  The scene shows multiple characters: Luffy, Zoro, Chopper (possibly), Franky (partially visible in a robot), Brook (partially visible), Jinbe (partially visible), and other crew members.  They are facing numerous opponents, including several individuals who seem to possess Flying Devil Fruits.  The panel emphasizes the scale of the battle and Luffy's determination to confront Kaido.  Several speech bubbles express the characters' determination and assessment of the situation.  The overall visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga.
