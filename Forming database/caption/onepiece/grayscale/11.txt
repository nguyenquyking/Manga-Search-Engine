One Piece manga panel depicting a large, serpentine creature emerging from the ocean.  People on a hot air balloon watch as the creature rises, causing significant water displacement.  King, a character with long hair and facial tattoos, speculates on the identity of the creature, suggesting it might be Joyboy.  Another character, seemingly confident, declares that this creature will beat him in the future.  The panel ends with a "To be continued" caption.
