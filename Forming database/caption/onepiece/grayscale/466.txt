One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Zoro, is surprised ("Huh?!") as large rocks explode around him. Another character is shown coughing ("Koff!!") after being hit.  A third character, partially obscured, observes the attack. The scene is highly dynamic, with motion lines indicating the force of the explosion and attacks.  The background shows a rocky, destructed landscape.  The word "Doom" is visible near an impact.
