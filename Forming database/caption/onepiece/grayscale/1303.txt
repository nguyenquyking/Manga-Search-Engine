One Piece manga panel depicting: A scene unfolds in three parts.  The first shows a woman (possibly a character already established in the manga) peering from behind a barred window as a small, tracked vehicle (resembling a bulldozer) passes by, emitting sounds represented by "SKREE SKREE". The second panel shows close-ups of two surprised faces reacting to something. The third showcases a wide shot of dramatic waterfalls cascading down cliffs outside Wano, with text indicating the location and a call to action ("Hang on, brothers and sisters!!").  The overall tone suggests a moment of urgency or surprise.
