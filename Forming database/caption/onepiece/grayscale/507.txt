A One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic battle scene.  A large skull-like creature with horns, positioned atop a building, roars and uses a large sword to push back an unseen force.  Smaller panels show a character, possibly Luffy, exhaling forcefully and another panel shows a splash as something impacts the ground. The main focus is a powerful attack;  a character fires a "Nari-Kabura Arrow," a high-energy projectile, causing a large explosion.  The style is dynamic, showcasing intense action and power.
