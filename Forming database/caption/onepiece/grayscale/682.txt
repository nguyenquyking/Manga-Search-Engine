One Piece manga panel depicting a multi-headed, serpentine creature, possibly a mythical Zoan type Devil Fruit user, launching a fiery attack.  Sanji deflects a volley of arrows, saving Luffy and the Straw Hats. Chopper is praised for his contribution.  The creature's attack is labeled "Strike!!" and it roars "Gyaaaa Aaah!!" while the Straw Hats react with shock and relief.  Perorin is visible in a separate panel, seemingly battling the creature earlier.  The scene is chaotic and action-packed, featuring a dramatic clash between the Straw Hats and their formidable opponent.
