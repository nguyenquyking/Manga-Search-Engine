Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  A character, possibly Big Mom (Mama), executes a powerful attack called "Mama-Raid," unleashing a swirling, octopus-like energy blast.  Another character is shown reacting to the attack,  experiencing a forceful impact. In another panel, a large, smiling character (possibly Kaido) observes the scene.  The panel suggests intense combat with significant destruction, using onomatopoeia like "CLANK" and "DOOM" to convey the scale of the attack.
