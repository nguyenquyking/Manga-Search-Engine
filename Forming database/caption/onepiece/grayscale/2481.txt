One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters, likely after the Paramount War.  One character, with spiky hair and glasses, recounts how they protected their village, which Pops cared for.  They mention the Grudge War against Blackbeard and how Pops's death is commemorated. The other character, with a large, fluffy hairstyle, reflects on Pops's cheapskate nature and how he never paid his share. The scene includes a distant view of a village and a close-up of the character wiping away a tear.  The panel shows a flashback to a moment of reflection on Pops's legacy and character.
