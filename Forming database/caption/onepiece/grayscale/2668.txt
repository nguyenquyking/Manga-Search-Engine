Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A dramatic scene unfolds in the One Piece manga.  Luffy, deeply worried, calls out to Zoro, who is shown injured and bleeding in the water.  Another character, seemingly a Straw Hat crewmate, urges Luffy to get Zoro onto the boat.  Meanwhile, a powerful, heavily tattooed antagonist looms, declaring it's "too early" for Zoro to die.  The scene emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the imminent threat to Zoro's life.
