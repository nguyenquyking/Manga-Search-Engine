One Piece manga panel depicting a tense scene.  A young man with spiky hair, possibly a swordsman, sits at a table, his expression serious.  An older, angry-looking man confronts him, while a woman and another man observe. A collection of knives is visible in a separate panel, suggesting the scene involves culinary skills and swordsmanship.  Dialogue boxes indicate a disagreement over a decision. The visual style is characteristic of One Piece, with dramatic shading and clear character expressions.
