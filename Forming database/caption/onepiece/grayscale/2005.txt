One Piece manga panel depicting a large, powerful figure wielding a massive weapon, possibly a naginata, in a dramatic attack.  The figure's face is partially obscured but features a distinct headpiece. Several smaller characters react in the panels below, showing expressions of fear or surprise.  One character appears to be a woman with dark hair.  The smaller characters are likely being impacted by the attack. The bottom panel shows the impact of the attack and uses onomatopoeia "THUD!!" to illustrate a heavy blow.  The scene suggests a fierce battle.
