One Piece manga panel depicting Zoro, Nami, and another character. Zoro, smoking a cigarette, comments on someone "poking his nose where it don't belong." Nami expresses surprise, saying "Whoa!" while pointing at a tool lying conveniently nearby.  Another character is present, but their actions and dialogue are less prominent. The scene takes place in a rustic interior setting. The overall mood is one of intrigue and slight conflict.
