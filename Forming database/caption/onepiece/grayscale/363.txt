One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A woman with horns, possibly Ulti, screams in distress as a large fire monster approaches the basement. Brook, riding a large cloud of what he initially mistakes for a cushion (but is revealed to be hair), falls.  Other characters, including possibly Zoro and another female character, react to the situation.  The scene shows a sense of urgency and impending battle.
