One Piece manga scene: Luffy and crew arrive at Wano, encountering a large dog-like creature attacking a ship.  Luffy expresses surprise ("Whoa! Hey!!"),  while another crew member shouts at the creature to stop.  The scene depicts initial confusion ("Where'd everybody go?", "Is this... Wano?") followed by chaos and action as the creature causes damage ("NABOOM!!").  The visual elements include a wrecked ship, stylized Japanese-inspired landscape, and the large animal, possibly a boar or dog.
