One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a hired killer attempts to silence someone, possibly for knowledge of Marijoa's hidden treasure.  The killer is shown bound in chains, laughing maniacally.  Another panel shows Luffy's straw hat left behind in a dark, possibly flooded, location.  A figure in a cloak walks away from the hat, carrying a wanted poster of Monkey D. Luffy. The final panel shows a view of Marijoa.  The overall narrative suggests a secretive operation gone awry, with the killer's failure potentially linked to the release of powerful, short-lived information.
