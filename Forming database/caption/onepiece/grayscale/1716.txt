One Piece Manga Panel Description:  The scene opens with a panoramic view of Pangaea Castle in Marijoa, one week after the Reverie's conclusion.  The subsequent panels depict the departure of world leaders following the conference, with several figures shown leaving on ships.  The final panels focus on journalists at the World Economic Journal office frantically working to create a headline covering the numerous events unfolding simultaneously.  A sense of urgency and chaos is conveyed through the speech bubbles and the journalist’s actions. No specific character names beyond general descriptions (e.g., world leaders, journalists) are identifiable in this image.
