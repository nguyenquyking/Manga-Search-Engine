Another female character, possibly using a Clima Tact, is shown reacting to the attack with visible shock and damage.  The attacker, Sheep Cloud, comments "Relaxing awa!!" and "I'll blow it all away with a gust of wind!"  The defender attempts to counter with a "Bending Finger Pistol" technique, but it proves ineffective.  The scene is dynamic with motion lines and impact effects showcasing the intensity of the fight.
