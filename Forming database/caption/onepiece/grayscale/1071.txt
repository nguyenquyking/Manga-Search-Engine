One Piece manga scene depicting a fierce battle at Skull Dome.  A massive dragon-like creature is being attacked; commands to "stop his breathing" and "sever his wind-pipe" are visible.  The creature appears to be wounded, with significant damage.  In the foreground, several characters, possibly samurai, engage in combat against a large, monstrous opponent.  The text indicates the fight is ongoing, and the final panel shows a determined character declaring the fight is not over.
