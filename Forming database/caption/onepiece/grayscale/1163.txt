One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring a question about Kaido's crew member names.  The answer explains that most are named after cards or card games, with exceptions for Drake, Apoo, and Hawkins.  Individual portraits of Who's-Who, Black Maria, Ulti, Page One, Sasaki, Holdem, and Babanuki are shown.  A separate question asks about the horn differences between Smile fruit eaters (Pleasures and Gifters), with the answer attributing the variation to fashion choices.  A chibi Sanadacchi Fan is also present.
