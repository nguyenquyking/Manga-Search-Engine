Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  Two characters, possibly pirates, are shown preparing to share a large, grotesque piece of food. One character remarks "What a sharp bastard!" while the other enthusiastically declares they'll split it in half and eat simultaneously.  A second scene depicts two smaller figures expressing gratitude by a large, wrecked ship-like structure with tentacles, suggesting a successful acquisition or fortunate event.  The overall tone is one of adventurous camaraderie and macabre humor.
