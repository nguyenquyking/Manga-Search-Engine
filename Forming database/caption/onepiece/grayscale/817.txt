One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A winged figure, possibly a Devil Fruit user, unleashes a powerful fiery attack labeled "Bluebird!!!"  Another character, seemingly using a fire-based ability, is shown mid-air, propelled by the force of the attack. The attack results in a massive explosion labeled "KRAsh!!" near a wooden structure, possibly a ship.  The scene is dynamic, filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia illustrating the intensity of the combat.  One panel shows a close-up of a character's shocked expression witnessing the event.
