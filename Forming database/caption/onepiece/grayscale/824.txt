One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Franky is shown screaming "HELP ME!!!" and "ROBIIIIN!!!" in distress, tears streaming down his face.  Other panels show Robin reacting with shock and concern, and other characters witnessing the event.  One character is about to utter a defiant phrase before their demise, and another pleads for time. The overall tone is one of urgency and desperation.
