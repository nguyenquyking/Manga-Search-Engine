One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic battle scene. A character, possibly Zoro, is shown falling into the water after being struck by a sword. Another character with spiky hair is shown in a close-up, shouting in shock and fear, possibly Luffy.  A third character, blond, with wide, fearful eyes, observes the scene, expressing the sentiment "It's so simple...Just throw away your ambition!!!"  Birds fly overhead, suggesting a coastal setting. The overall mood is intense and violent.
