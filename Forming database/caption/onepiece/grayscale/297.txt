One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Numbers Rokki, a large, muscular character, guards a door to a basement armory.  He is attacked by a smaller character (likely an ally of the Straw Hats) who uses a quick maneuver to disable Rokki. Another character, Fuga, assists by holding Rokki down.  The scene is chaotic with impact sounds and motion lines indicating fast-paced action.  The smaller character's attack successfully allows access to the armory.
