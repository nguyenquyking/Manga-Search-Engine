One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A large, shadowy figure with a grinning face, possibly representing a powerful antagonist, confronts several characters.  Text bubbles indicate a power struggle over poneglyphs and impending conflict.  The antagonist threatens to claim all manpower and treasure.  Zoro (implied, not explicitly shown) is present, as suggested by text.  A complex mechanical contraption is also central to the scene. The overall tone is intense and action-oriented.
