The second panel shows a conversation between a woman (possibly Kikunojo) and a man (possibly Kin'emon). The third panel illustrates Raizo being swept away at sea. The fourth panel shows a group of characters shipwrecked, with one (likely Kin'emon) observing the situation.  The final panel features the characters washing ashore on Dressrosa, with Momonosuke among them.  The narrative focuses on the escape, shipwreck, and subsequent arrival on Dressrosa after being separated from Kanjuro while pursuing Raizo.
