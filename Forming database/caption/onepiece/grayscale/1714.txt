One Piece manga depicting a tense meeting of world leaders.  Multiple Kings are shown at a large table, silently observing each other, while smaller nations are manipulated into conflict.  The scene highlights the underlying power struggles and deep-seated historical tensions between the countries.  A key visual element is the "round table," ironically juxtaposed with the underlying conflict and lack of genuine equality.  The dialogue reveals concerns about maintaining peace while acknowledging the inherent difficulties and potential for violence.
