Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A fierce battle unfolds between a samurai and Jack, one of Kaido's All-Stars.  The samurai, wielding a sword, attacks Jack, who is heavily built and possesses large horns.  Jack is depicted reacting to the samurai's attack with impact effects and speech bubbles displaying pain and surprise ("GFFH!!"). The scene also shows other onlookers reacting to the intense battle, showcasing the high stakes of the conflict.  The text clearly indicates the samurai's warning ("DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH SAMURAI!!!") and the observers' commentary on the battle's intensity ("WHAT A HIGH-LEVEL BATTLE!!").  The overall visual style is characteristic of One Piece's dynamic action sequences.
