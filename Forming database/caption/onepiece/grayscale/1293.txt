One Piece manga panel depicting intense battle scenes and dialogue.  A character, possibly Kaido, is shown engaging in a fierce slash attack, with impact sound effects.  Other panels show Queen and Kid reacting to the battle, with Queen expressing surprise and Kid smirking in agreement.  Dialogue boxes express disbelief at an alliance of pirates potentially defeating an Emperor.  A character (possibly Eustass Kid) is given permission to kill.  The overall tone is one of dramatic action and strategic planning.
