One Piece manga panel depicting Wano, Act Two.  The scene shows a landscape featuring Atamayana (Head Mountain) in Kuri, Wano.  In the foreground, there are sound effects suggesting a musical performance ("Be-Be-Beng") and industrial sounds ("Clang," "Tink," "Kchang").  A woman, possibly a geisha, plays a musical instrument.  Another character with a mask is shown reacting, possibly to the music or the industrial sounds. The panel clearly establishes the location and sets a scene of contrast between traditional Japanese sounds and the sounds of industry.
