One Piece manga panel depicting Gol D. Roger, captain of the Roger Pirates, disbanding his crew.  Roger is shown with a large grin, announcing the disbandment while a ship sails away on the horizon.  Other panels show two whales, seemingly anticipating a significant event, described as a "birthing," possibly referencing a new era or power shift.  Additional characters, possibly Roger's crew members, express anticipation and excitement about this upcoming event. The overall mood is celebratory yet carries the weight of a momentous occasion.
