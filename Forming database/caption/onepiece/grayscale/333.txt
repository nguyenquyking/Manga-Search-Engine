One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation between Stealth Black and a character strongly implied to be Sanji.  Stealth Black boasts about his superior scientific knowledge and his ability to replicate Germa's science.  Sanji, seemingly unimpressed, counters that he could have easily defeated Stealth Black earlier while he was wearing a special suit.  The scene culminates in Stealth Black's capture and Sanji's insistence on not being treated like family.  The visual elements include intense action lines, expressions of anger and determination, and the destruction of the environment surrounding the characters.
