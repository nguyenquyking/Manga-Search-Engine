One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between a large, monstrous figure and a group of subordinates. The monstrous figure, possibly a member of the enemy crew, declares that the subordinates have lost their chance to gain power and are now useless dead weight.  The subordinates, showing various expressions of fear and apprehension, are berated for their failure.  The monstrous figure explains their only remaining purpose is to die gloriously for the crew.  The final panel shows the monstrous figure agreeing with a subordinate's interpretation of this as an order to die.  Several unnamed subordinates are visible throughout the scene.
