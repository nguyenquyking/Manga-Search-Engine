This One Piece manga panel depicts Red-Haired Shanks, identified as the chief of the Red-Haired Pirates, with a bounty of 4,048,900,000 Berries.  A second panel shows a wanted poster for Shanks displayed in what appears to be a large hall filled with people.  Text describes the queen of Totto Land, ruling with 85 children, and her distrust of anyone outside her family. A third panel shows a man, possibly a subordinate, reacting with a gulp to the description of the queen's power.  The overall scene contrasts Shanks's immense bounty with the power and paranoia of the Totto Land queen.
