One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of urgent discussion and concern.  A character, possibly a high-ranking official, is informed that the Kin'emon's thoroughness in gathering information is unexpected.  Another character reports that no ships are at the dock, yet a fleet is approaching Onigashima.  A third character expresses worry that three battleships haven't returned and four pirates have been sighted outside.  Luffy, Zoro, and Eustass Kid are named as among those sighted. The overall mood is one of high tension and impending danger.
