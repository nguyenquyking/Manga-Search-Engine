One Piece manga panel depicting a large, muscular, Minotaur-like character with blond hair,  large tusks, and bandages,  roaring "BAR-AAG!!" He is in a combat stance. Speech bubbles indicate he's putting his opponent to sleep permanently and has forgiven them for lying about the Samurai.  Another character's leg, partially visible and wearing pink clothing, is seen beneath the Minotaur. Text indicates the country has already paid the price for sheltering the Minotaur's opponent.  The scene is dynamic and violent, with splashes of color emphasizing the impact.
