The scene takes place in a multi-story building, with text indicating floor levels.  Kin'emon's exclamation "Got it! Just you wait, Kin'emon!!" suggests urgency and impending action. Another character expresses concern, stating "But my lord, you mustn't!"  The panel ends with a cliffhanger and a "naughty" comment accompanied by a heart symbol.
