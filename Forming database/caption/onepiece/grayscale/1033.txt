One Piece manga scene depicting a battle on the Performance Floor inside the Dome.  A character, possibly Apoo, in a dark-colored, buttoned coat is being attacked.  Another character, appearing to be a member of the CP0, performs a "Phoenix" attack, indicated by a swirling visual effect.  A third character, blond and possibly Queen, reacts with surprise ("YIKES!!!").  The scene is chaotic, with onomatopoeia and motion lines indicating high-impact attacks and movements. The words "720-pound" and "Don't let him escape!!" suggest the significance of capturing Apoo.
