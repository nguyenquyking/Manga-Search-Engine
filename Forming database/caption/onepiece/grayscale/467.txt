One Piece manga panel depicting a battle.  A character, seemingly Zoro, uses a two-sword style, executing a "Clear Lance" attack.  His opponent is falling, exclaiming "I'm falling!!"  Zoro's opponent earlier stated,  "At least let me die by the sword! Show a little respect!!!"  The scene shows a dust cloud and debris after the attack.  In the final panel, a close-up shows a masked character, possibly a villain, stating "I'd ask the same of you!!"  The text "To be continued!" indicates the battle is ongoing.
