One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Nami is screaming, seemingly in distress, while Franky is fighting a large, lizard-like creature.  Usopp is aiming for the creature's weak points ("eyeballs," "nostrils," "temple jaw").  The creature is attacking Nami and Franky, with visual onomatopoeia illustrating the impact.  In another panel, Komachiyo is seen running towards a location, while a female character (likely Robin) strategizes, mentioning giving commands to enemy fighters and that "Horselina helped feed millet dumplings."
