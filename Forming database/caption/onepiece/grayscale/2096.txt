One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  In the first, Tsuru gives Olin some Oshiruko, which is described as sweet and tasty.  Chopper is present, deemed "cute".  In the next panel, a group, including Chopper and two children, discusses going to Okobore Town in Kuri, Wano, seemingly linked to a memory recovery.  A woman expresses relief that someone liked the Oshiruko.  A large character, possibly a pirate captain, with a skull motif on his hat, gives a thumbs-up, eager to go to Udon, highlighting the "fateful battle" looming nine days away.  The overall mood shifts from pleasant (Oshiruko scene) to apprehensive (journey to Udon).
