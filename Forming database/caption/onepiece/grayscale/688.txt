One Piece manga panel depicting Queen, Perorin, and an unnamed antagonist.  Queen is enraged,  suffering damage but taunting Perorin about their endurance.  The antagonist is gleefully explaining a plan involving chemicals to extend a gigantification effect for 30 minutes, despite acknowledging risks.  The antagonist's dialogue suggests a disregard for appearance and a cynical view of pirates. Visual elements include speech bubbles, expressions of pain and triumph, and a depiction of a ship in the sea.
