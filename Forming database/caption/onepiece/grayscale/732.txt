One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A large, dragon-like creature with sharp horns and a skeletal face clashes with a smaller, dark-cloaked figure. The smaller figure seemingly uses a sword or similar weapon, resulting in a powerful impact that cracks the ground.  The final panel shows a massive skull-like entity erupting with energy, possibly indicating a devastating attack or transformation.  The onomatopoeia suggests intense action and impact ("WHAM!!", "KLANG!!", "DOOM!!").  Specific character names are not identifiable from the image alone.
