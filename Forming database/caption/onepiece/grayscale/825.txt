One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A Straw Hat pirate is shown captured and surrounded by enemies in a swirling vortex.  Another panel shows Sanji observing the scene, commenting on the Straw Hat's plight.  A character, possibly an enemy, states that the captured Straw Hat is begging for help, deemed "pathetic." The setting appears to be a large banquet hall on multiple floors, with a cat-like figure observed earlier. The overall mood is tense and action-filled.
