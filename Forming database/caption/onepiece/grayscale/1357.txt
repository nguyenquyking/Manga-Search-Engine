One Piece manga panel depicting a strategic planning meeting.  Several characters, including Eustass Kid, Straw Hat Luffy (implied), and other Akayza Samurai are shown discussing a raid plan.  The discussion centers on using soldiers as a diversion while the main force, Kin'emon's group, attacks the primary target.  The scene shows a fleet of ships at sea, highlighting the scope of the operation.  The dialogue focuses on the enemy's awareness and the plan's effectiveness, with some characters expressing skepticism about the "idiots" involved in the diversion.  A close-up of a character, possibly a high-ranking Akayza Samurai, shows his thoughtful expression.
