Here's a detailed caption describing the One Piece manga panels:  **Panel 1:**  A wide shot depicting Onigashima, a massive skull-shaped island, located above the Wano mainland.  The island is shown moving, indicated by motion lines and sound effects ("Grrrrgg...").  **Panel 2:**  A close-up focusing on Luffy and other characters reacting to Onigashima's imminent arrival at the Flower Capital.  A text box indicates only 15 minutes remain until impact. Luffy appears distressed, his body distorted in a display of shock or exertion.  Other, smaller characters are visible, but not clearly identifiable.  **Panel 3:**  A dramatic close-up of Onigashima's descent towards the Flower Capital.  The island's skull-like features are emphasized, along with sound effects ("Waaaaaaa!!!!" and "Raaaaah!!") indicating its destructive approach.  Architectural details, suggesting a Japanese-inspired design, are visible within the skull's mouth.
