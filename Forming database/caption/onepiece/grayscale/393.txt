One Piece manga panel depicting Sanji destroying a Germa 66 science weapon.  A large monstrous figure watches, disappointed. Sanji, in a suit, states he's rejecting his Germa heritage.  The scene shows Sanji's self-destruction of the weapon with a resulting explosion.  The panel includes onomatopoeia representing sound effects such as "CRUNCH," "BOOM," and "CLANK". A snail is seen in the bottom panel, likely indicating a communication device.
