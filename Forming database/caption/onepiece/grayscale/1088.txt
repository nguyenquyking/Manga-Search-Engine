One Piece SBS Question Corner features Sanji at ages 40 and 60, showcasing his appearance and lifestyle changes.  At 40, he's depicted with longer hair, still somewhat mischievous. At 60, his hair is even longer and he appears more relaxed, possibly retired ("Gone fishin...").  Another section answers a fan question regarding Izo and Kiku's weapon choices in chapter 962.  The answer explains that Kiku held her brother's gun, and Izo's katana use was due to lack of confidence, contrasting with his later sharpshooting skill.  Illustrations show Izo and Kiku as children and young adults, showcasing their contrasting weapon usage.
