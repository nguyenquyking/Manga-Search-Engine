One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A character, possibly Kaido, unleashes a powerful ink-based attack, creating swirling ink clouds ("Ink Clouds!", "Puff Puff", "Vooom Vooom!!").  This attack is described as something unseen before ("Whatever he's doing, it's something we haven't seen before!").  The attack manifests as rain and ink arrows ("Rain down, Ink Arrows!!").  Another character, seemingly an opponent, is shown reacting with surprise and shock ("Huh?!"), and experiencing damage ("Krash!", "Gyaa!!", "Aaaaah!!", "Urgh!!!").  The attack impacts ships, causing them to capsize in a turbulent sea ("Ukiyo Portrait: Evening Shower!!", "Hard Aport!!").  The scene emphasizes the scale and destructive power of the attack.
