One Piece manga panel depicting prisoners at the Udon labor camp in Wano.  The upper panel shows a large-scale view of the camp, including a weapons factory and the prisoners working, with text indicating the tasks ("Strike the Iron!!", "Haul the Stone!!").  The lower panels show close-ups: a large, muscular prisoner reacting angrily to a meager amount of food; and another prisoner receiving a similarly small portion. The scene highlights the harsh conditions of the prison and the prisoners' exhaustion and frustration.  The text boxes illustrate the prisoners' complaints about their workload and meager rations.
