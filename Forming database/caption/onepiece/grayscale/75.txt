A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Multiple identical-looking female characters, possibly illusions, named Fata Morgana, wielding long staffs, attack another character (Emi) who is trying to dodge their "Thunder Ball" attack. One Fata Morgana is confirmed to be real while four are illusions.  The scene takes place in a watery environment, possibly reflecting the illusionary nature of the attack.  The text indicates that only one of the five attacks is real.
