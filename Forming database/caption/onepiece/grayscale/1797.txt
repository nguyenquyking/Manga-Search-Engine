One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in Flower Capital, Wano.  Trafalgar Law is mentioned to have escaped, causing anger from a high-ranking official (possibly a Shogun or similar).  The official is shown expressing displeasure, while another character apologizes.  A third character, seemingly a torturer, is pleased by the situation.  The panel also shows the apprehension of two ringleaders: Trafalgar Law and Luffy (Straw Hat).  The overall mood is one of tension and triumph for the Wano authorities.
