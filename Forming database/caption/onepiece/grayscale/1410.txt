One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between a seemingly powerful figure and a younger character, possibly a descendant of the Kurozumi family. The older character reveals that he eliminated the people responsible for the younger character's parents' deaths, who were killed due to persecution in Wano. He explains that the younger character, born into a popular theater troupe, survived by acting, and now has a "grand role" to play.  The scene also shows a flashback to the parents' deaths on stage and the older figure is described as trustworthy. The younger character's future involves dying as a Koziki, yet ultimately living their life as a true Koziki without anyone noticing.  The visual style is characteristic of One Piece, with exaggerated expressions and dynamic panel layouts.
