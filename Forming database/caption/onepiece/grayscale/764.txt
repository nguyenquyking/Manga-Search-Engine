One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  The top panel shows Trafalgar Law,  and a red-haired pirate (likely a subordinate) engaged in combat.  Law appears to be defending himself. The middle panel shows a large, skull-headed Minotaur-like creature, seemingly created by a powerful attack labeled "DOOM!!", crashing to the ground. The bottom panels illustrate the aftermath; a large swathe of land is destroyed, with rocks and debris flying through the air.  The scene is chaotic and depicts a powerful attack resulting in significant destruction.
