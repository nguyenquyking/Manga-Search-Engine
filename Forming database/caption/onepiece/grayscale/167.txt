One Piece manga scene depicting a fierce battle.  A large, scaled figure (likely a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user) wielding a spiked club attacks Luffy, who uses Gum-Gum techniques.  Luffy is shown reacting to the attack, and the impact is depicted with large "BOOM!!" and motion lines. The large figure yells "One more hit...and if that doesn't work...then I've lost!!!" while Luffy counters with "Show me what you've got, boy!!".  A subsequent panel shows Luffy seemingly successfully using his "Iron Body" technique against an attack, with the opponent surprised. The scene is dynamic, filled with impact lines and speech bubbles indicating force and exertion.
