A blond-haired man with a mask, possibly a pirate or explorer, sits on a beach, writing in a journal. He is near a large, craggy island resembling a giant crab claw, which is surrounded by dangerous currents.  Text boxes describe the island's dangerous nature and how it traps sailors, referring to those caught as "victims". The man seems contemplative, questioning the use of the word "victim" in his notes.  The scene is dark and ominous, highlighting the island's perilous environment.
