One Piece manga panel depicting Zoro expressing regret for his injury, while a woman tends to his wound.  Another character, seemingly a child, expresses gratitude.  A separate panel shows Zoro's pained reaction as the woman treats his shoulder.  Further panels reveal the woman stole special toad oil to heal his sword wounds, and a final panel shows a grinning character.  The scene unfolds in multiple locations: a street, and later, what seems to be a hidden room.
