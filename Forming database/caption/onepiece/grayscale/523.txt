One Piece manga scene depicting Zoro and Sanji standing amidst rubble near a large, ornate Japanese-style building.  Zoro's arrival is announced with "Zoro-Juro's Back!!". Sanji shouts "Get 'em, Sangoro!!".  In another panel, Queen and King react, and a healed character (possibly Yamato) expresses concern about the future.  The scene shows significant destruction and smoke.
