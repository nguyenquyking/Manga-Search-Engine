One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene aboard a ship.  Whitebeard, his face partially obscured, addresses a younger man, possibly his brother, expressing excitement about a "grand adventure".  Other characters, including Oden, are shown celebrating their arrival.  Meanwhile, below,  a woman with dark hair questions whether she will be thrown overboard, another character discusses payment, and Dogstorm, Cat Viper, and other characters are surprised by their presence. The scene is dynamic, suggesting a new chapter or arc is beginning.
