One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in a prison cell.  A wounded prisoner, possibly a subordinate of Kaido, lies on the ground, bleeding.  Two larger, more imposing guards, likely members of Kaido's crew, stand over him. One guard is speaking to the prisoner, who is clearly injured and in pain, threatening hard labor and loyalty to Kaido. The scene is violent and shows the harsh realities of Kaido's rule. The visual elements include a prison cell, blood, and the guards' imposing figures.  The overall tone is one of threat and intimidation.
