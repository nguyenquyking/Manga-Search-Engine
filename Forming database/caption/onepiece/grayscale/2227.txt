One Piece manga panel depicting a tense scene. Trafalgar Law is warned ("Don't do it, Trafalgar!") as he prepares an action.  Law is shown using a small sea prism stone, possibly a nail,  which is explained as only being craftable in Wano.  Another character, possibly Law's opponent, reacts with surprise ("Not him again!").  The Straw Hat Pirates' symbol is shown, indicating their involvement.  A significant action, possibly a sword attack ("Straw Sword!!!"), is depicted with motion lines and sound effects ("BWO"). The scene is dynamic and action-packed, showcasing a confrontation possibly involving a small, highly specialized weapon.
