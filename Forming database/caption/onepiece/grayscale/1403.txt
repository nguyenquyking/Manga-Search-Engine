One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a character (likely Kin'emon) slipping and expressing immense debt to the Kozuki clan.  The second panel shows a flashback of a past event, possibly related to the "Mountain God Incident," with a figure (possibly Denjiro) causing chaos.  The third panel features Denjiro in the present, shocked and questioning the situation, alongside other characters reacting with surprise and fear.  The overall narrative centers on the revelation of a past incident and its impact on the present.  The panels contain dialogue referencing Kin'emon, Lord Oden, Denjiro and the Kozuki Clan, hinting at a significant plot development.
