One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A powerful, flaming-haired figure, likely an Emperor, scolds smaller figures, referring to them as "brats."  The Emperor boasts of sinking hundreds of people and declares the "time for dreaming is over." The Emperor's dialogue boxes indicate immense power and disregard for their opponents.  In the lower panel, smaller, seemingly mechanical figures are shown fleeing, highlighting the Emperor's dominance.  The scene emphasizes the overwhelming power of the Emperor and the insignificance of the opponents.
