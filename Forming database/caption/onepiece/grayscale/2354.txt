One Piece manga panel depicting the emotional reaction of a large, obese character, possibly Urashima, to a woman rejecting him and cutting off his topknot.  The character is shown crying and making a distressed sound ("HRMPH"). Other onlookers are whispering ("MURMUR," "MUTTER") and observing the scene.  One panel shows the woman walking away with a sword. The overall scene depicts humiliation and social rejection within a Japanese-inspired setting.
