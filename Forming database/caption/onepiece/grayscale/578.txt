One Piece manga panel depicting a reunion scene.  Saul, a giant, joyfully greets Robin, who appears significantly older and taller than in their previous meeting.  Other characters present include an older man expressing his happiness at the reunion and another smaller figure possibly representing a younger Robin. Saul expresses his longing to see Robin again, while she is cautioned by an unseen figure (likely a skull) to not go.  The scene is marked by emotional reunion and a sense of urgency.
