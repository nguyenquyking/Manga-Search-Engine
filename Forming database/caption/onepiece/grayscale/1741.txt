One Piece manga panel depicting two scenes.  The first shows three figures, possibly Zoro, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro, standing before two grave markers, while a fourth figure, likely Yasui, watches from behind. The second shows a large group of samurai, including seven with red scabbards, one shinobi, and one child, marching across a barren landscape.  The text indicates these samurai are not seeking revenge but are fulfilling a 20-year-old pledge.  Another panel shows a conversation between a character (possibly Zoro) and an older figure (possibly Oden), discussing the cursed sword Enma.  The overall scene is tense and suggests an impending conflict.
