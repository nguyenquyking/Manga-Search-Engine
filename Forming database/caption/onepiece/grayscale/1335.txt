One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where several characters are engaged in a conversation.  Kaido sits on a raised platform, seemingly making an announcement involving Yamato.  A woman with long hair expresses concern about the difficulty of the task.  Another character, possibly a challenger, enthusiastically accepts a direct challenge.  A heated exchange follows between a woman with horns and a man in a hat. The final panel shows three figures—one smiling mischievously, another masked, and a third with a stern expression—suggesting a potential conflict or confrontation is about to occur.  The overall scene hints at a significant event involving Yamato and a forthcoming challenge.
