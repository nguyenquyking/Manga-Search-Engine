One Piece manga panel depicting a scene inside a Japanese-style building.  Several characters are shown, including a visibly exhausted individual (possibly Luffy's crew member) reacting to the intensity of the ongoing battle. Another character, possibly a samurai, expresses uncertainty about the situation. The scene shows a group of people gathered in a room, seemingly discussing the battle raging on the island, with Luffy's group engaged with Kaido's forces. A map shows the location of a treasure repository. The overall tone suggests urgency and exhaustion following a fierce battle.
