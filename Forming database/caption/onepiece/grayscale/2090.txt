A One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A woman in a kimono, likely Hiyori, is being attacked; a sword slices through her.  Kyoshiro is shown in the upper panel, seemingly shocked, with other characters shouting "Boss Kyoshiro?!" and "No! Wait!!". The overall scene suggests a betrayal or unexpected attack.  The onomatopoeia "SLICE" emphasizes the swiftness of the attack.
