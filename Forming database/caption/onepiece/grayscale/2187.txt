One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in a Japanese-style town.  Luffy, identifiable by his straw hat and characteristic grin, interacts with a young child named Toko.  Luffy is amused by Toko's reaction and finds their name humorous.  Toko is dressed in traditional Japanese attire. Other characters are present, but less prominent. The scene features a dialogue about Toko's name and Luffy's presence at the Oiran's procession.  The overall tone is lighthearted and comedic.
