One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large crocodile-like creature, possibly a Zoan Devil Fruit user, attacks Pay-Pay, who cries for help.  Another character, unseen except for their arm and hand, captures Pay-Pay and declares their intent to melt her down.  The top panel shows a previous event where a "Special Attack, Green Star" is used, causing destruction.  The scene is violent and dynamic, emphasizing the creature's power and the characters' desperation.
