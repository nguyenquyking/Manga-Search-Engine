One Piece manga panel depicting a female character recounting a past encounter.  She remembers Kawamatsu, a powerful samurai, cheering her up after a castle siege.  He helped her escape and shared his meager food despite his own hunger.  The scene flashes back to the siege and then forward to the present day where she expresses longing for a reunion with Kawamatsu, now separated from her for approximately 13 years.  Other characters, possibly allies, are present in the final panel, suggesting a continued narrative.
