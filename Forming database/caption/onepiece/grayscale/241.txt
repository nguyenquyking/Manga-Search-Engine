One Piece manga panel depicting significant battle damage. A large castle is crumbling, with fire and a massive crack visible in the roof.  The text indicates the castle and island are half-destroyed.  A character (likely Luffy, given the final panel) is shown injured and in pain, commenting on the opponent's strength ("He's so tough!!"). Another character expresses frustration and misery over the destruction.  The scene showcases widespread destruction and the aftermath of a fierce battle.
