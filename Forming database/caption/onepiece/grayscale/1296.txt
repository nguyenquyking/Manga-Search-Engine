One Piece manga scene depicting chaotic action. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro are present, with Zoro yelling at Luffy.  Other Straw Hats are visible in the background, reacting to a loud explosion or impact.  Text bubbles indicate various exclamations, including "They're all idiots," "Same to you, Roronoa!,"  "You're the last one who should be talking, Luffy!!," and "I should have known!! You just had to go and cause a scene, Jaggy!!"  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia suggesting loud noises and powerful movements.  Jaggy is also present, seemingly initiating the chaos.
