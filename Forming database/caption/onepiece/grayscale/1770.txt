One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large, monstrous figure is shown, possibly a corrupted samurai or yokai, reacting with anguish ("AAH!!").  A smaller, fox-like character, possibly a mink, is shown reacting with shock and fear, trying to escape ("GET OFF!!").  The larger figure predicts another great war in 13 years, while the smaller figure expresses disbelief ("HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN THIS TO A FOX?!").  The panel also shows the larger figure's prediction of a samurai resurgence ("THE DAY WILL COME WHEN THE SAMURAI...").  The overall tone is one of impending conflict and foreshadowing.  Specific character names are not explicitly provided within the image.
