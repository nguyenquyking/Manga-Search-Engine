One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A minotaur-like character, possibly a member of the Armored Division, attacks with a move called "V-for-Victory Flash."  His opponent, wielding a complex mechanical weapon labeled "Franken-Sword," is shown reacting to the attack.  The scene is dynamic with speed lines and impact effects. The Armored Division member shouts "What's wrong with you?!" while the opponent shouts "Pay attention! I'm your opponent here!" and "Franken-Sword!!"  The opponent is also shown being struck and yelling in pain.
