One Piece manga panel depicting a large ship's propeller-like structure washed ashore on a tropical beach. Two characters, possibly pirates, are discussing the ship. One character, with shoulder-length dark hair and a wide-brimmed hat, expresses approval ("I like it!").  The other character, also wearing a hat, questions the point of sailing a nameless ship ("What's the point of sailing on a ship with no name?"). The word "STRIKER?" appears in a speech bubble, possibly relating to the ship's name or a potential name. The scene suggests discovery and contemplation of an unusual vessel.
