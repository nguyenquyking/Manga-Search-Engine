One Piece manga scene depicting a frantic escape.  A large, round woman carries two smaller women, appearing injured, while fleeing.  Text indicates they escaped through the air after others, possibly Bepo and his friends, were captured. The situation is critical; the city could plunge into chaos, and information about ankle tattoos has been compromised.  The goal is to control Traffy, using the captured individuals as bait.  The setting is a cityscape with traditional Asian-style buildings.
