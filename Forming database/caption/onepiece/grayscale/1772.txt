One Piece manga scene depicting a distraught, large, masked character, possibly a mink, grieving over Lady Hiyori's fate.  He's robbing graves, stating he'll even tear off his own arm if necessary to feed his hunger. His guilt over failing to protect Lady Hiyori is evident.  Another character, possibly a dog-like mink, is shown nearby, possibly observing or participating in the grave-robbing.  The scene is set in a snowy graveyard with numerous swords sticking out of the snow. The overall mood is dark and desperate.
