Jewelry Bonney, a Worst Generation pirate captain, angrily confronts someone off-panel, vowing revenge ("You'll pay!!").  Another panel shows her reacting to unexpectedly encountering someone ("I didn't think I'd run across him...").  Simultaneously, another character expresses envy and distress. A third character comments on a seemingly perfect "slave". The scene takes place in a town square, with background buildings suggesting a European-style setting.  The overall mood is tense and dramatic.
