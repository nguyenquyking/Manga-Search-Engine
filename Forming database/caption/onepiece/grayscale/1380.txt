One Piece manga panel depicting a naval battle.  Wano's high-precision weaponry is used from a ship, firing on enemy vessels.  A character, possibly a commander, orders "Pull back!! More distance!!" as cannons fire, causing explosions and significant damage to the enemy ships.  The enemy cries out in distress ("Gyaaa ha ha ha!!!" and "Aaaaah!!!"). The scene showcases the destructive power of Wano's weaponry and the strategic maneuvering of the attacking force.
