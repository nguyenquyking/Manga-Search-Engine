One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a large, horned, heavily built man, possibly a commander or high-ranking officer, orders the arrest of someone.  Several smaller figures are shown being subdued, possibly Zoro and his crewmates, who appear injured and surprised. The large man is expressing frustration at the situation, suggesting the captured individuals disrupted his plans or orders. The setting appears to be a town or village with traditional Asian-style architecture.  The text boxes contain orders, reactions, and exclamations from the characters.  The overall mood is tense and action-filled.
