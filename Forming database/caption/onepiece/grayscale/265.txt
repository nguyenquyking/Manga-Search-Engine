One Piece manga panel depicting a culinary competition.  Characters discuss the Paradise Farm's superior ingredients and the low quality of buckwheat flour available to a chef (possibly Sanji) and his associates.  A chef, potentially Sanji, considers revealing the inferior quality of the flour used by a competitor to the judges or public.  The scene shows concern over the competition's quality and a possible plan to expose a competitor's use of subpar ingredients through spreading the truth, highlighting the importance of ingredient quality in the chef's battle.  The visual style is consistent with One Piece's manga art.
