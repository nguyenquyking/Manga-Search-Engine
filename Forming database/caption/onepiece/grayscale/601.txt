One Piece manga scene depicting a chaotic battle.  A large, horned figure, possibly a devil fruit user, is at the center, creating a powerful swirling vortex.  Several characters are shown reacting to this attack, including Boa Hancock, who appears to be firing a weapon.  Other characters are shown being struck by the vortex or engaging in close-quarters combat. The text includes onomatopoeia representing the sounds and forces of the attack.  The overall scene is highly dynamic and suggests a powerful attack launched by the central figure, impacting multiple combatants simultaneously.
