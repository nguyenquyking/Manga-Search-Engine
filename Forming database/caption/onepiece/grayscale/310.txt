Zoro is wielding two swords, and the shadowy figure seems to be attacking him with a flaming weapon.  The scene is chaotic, with impact effects and sound effects visible.  Another panel shows a character, possibly a subordinate, observing Zoro's struggle and commenting on his speed.  The background suggests a rocky, possibly coastal environment.
