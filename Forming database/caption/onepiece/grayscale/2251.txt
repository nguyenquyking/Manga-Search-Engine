One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Luffy, visibly strained and panting ("Huff, Huff... Weez, Weez!!"), is engaged in a powerful clash with a large, monstrous opponent.  The impact is shown with large "DA DA DA" sound effects and radiating energy lines.  Other characters, including a woman with long hair and several men in traditional Japanese-style clothing, observe the conflict, with one character questioning "Who's that fella?".  The monstrous opponent roars ("RAAAAH!!!", "AAAAAH!!!"), indicating intense struggle. The scene is set against a backdrop of traditional Japanese architecture, adding context to the location of the fight.
