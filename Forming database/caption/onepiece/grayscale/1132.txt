One Piece manga panel depicting a large ship sailing into the New World.  The scene includes text boxes with dialogue between characters, including a discussion about a spirited young pirate and a cherry pie.  A man, possibly a doctor, offers medicine.  The visual focus is on the impressive scale of the ship and its entry into the New World, indicated by a banner.  There is no clear identification of named characters beyond references to "Thatch" and the implication of an unnamed Shichibukai.
