One Piece manga panel depicting a large-scale attack.  A powerful, spiraling blue beam of energy erupts from the ground, causing destruction and debris to fly.  Trafalgar Law is shown reacting to the attack, with speech bubbles indicating concern and urgency ("WILLE!!", "Captain!!").  Other characters, including a large, enraged figure (possibly a member of Law's crew), are also visible in smaller panels, exhibiting fear and shock, attempting to intervene and expressing concern for their captain.  The text "Puncture..." suggests the nature of the attack.  The overall scene is chaotic and dramatic, highlighting a significant moment of conflict.
