Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A large, powerful fist, labeled "PISTOL!!!", attacks Koby.  Luffy, visibly upset, shouts "Stop it!! You're making Koby uncomfortable!!"  Another panel shows a close-up of a menacing, scarred face identifying the attacker as a Straw Hat.  The final panel depicts Luffy, along with a character resembling T-Bone and another character, intervening.  T-Bone shouts "Stop right there!!!" The scene is dynamic and action-packed, focusing on a conflict involving Luffy, Koby, and a powerful antagonist.
