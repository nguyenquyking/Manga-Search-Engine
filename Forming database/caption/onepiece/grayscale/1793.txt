One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Gyukimaru and his men, armed with large firearms, attack, shouting "We're here for revenge, Gyukimaru!!"  They target a group including a large, possibly animalistic figure, stating their weapons are for "wild beasts".  Another character, possibly Lady Hiyori, is warned to stay back.  A separate panel shows a character observing the scene from afar, questioning the affiliation of the men.  The attackers declare they'll shoot everyone.  The overall scene is one of violent action and revenge.
