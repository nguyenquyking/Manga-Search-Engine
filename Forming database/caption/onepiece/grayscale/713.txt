One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes and characters.  Top panel shows Kiku, a female samurai with bandages, seemingly in pain, being questioned.  A map indicates a route from the Treasure Repository to Castle 3F.  The middle panel shows Kiku interacting with another character (possibly Zoro) while exhibiting a stoic demeanor.  The bottom panel shows Izo and another character discussing the future of Wano after its opening.  A chaotic scene in the background suggests a battle or destruction.  The overall mood is tense and action-oriented.
