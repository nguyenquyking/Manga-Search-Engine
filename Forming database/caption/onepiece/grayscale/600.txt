One Piece manga scene depicting multiple characters in action.  A large, horned, dinosaur-like creature is submerged, laughing, while another character comments, "I suppose no one in the area is on my side anymore!!"  A second panel shows the same creature partially submerged, laughing and saying, "Ha ha ha...what a laugh! The fewer people in my way, the better."  In a separate panel, Franky (Iron Bro) looks surprised, witnessing a spinning mechanical device.  Another character observes, "Huh?! That thing spins?!"  Franky is then shown asking for help.  A subsequent panel shows the creature again, this time from above, and another character yells "What the--?!"  In the final panel, Franky warns others, "Watch out, Iron Bro!", highlighting advanced technology.  The overall scene is chaotic, with multiple characters reacting to the unexpected appearance and actions of the dinosaur-like creature and its technology.
