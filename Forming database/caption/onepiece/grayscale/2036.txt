One Piece manga scene depicting a Sumo Inferno spectacle initiated by Queen.  A large, striped, sumo-wrestler-like figure dominates the center, surrounded by cheering, horned onlookers.  In the upper panels, other characters are shown; one appears to be a high-ranking member, smoking a cigar, expressing disdain. Other panels show Luffy and a smaller character observing the spectacle, with Luffy seemingly bound or restrained.  The scene is chaotic and energetic, highlighting Queen's special device performance.
