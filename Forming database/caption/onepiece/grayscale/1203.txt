This One Piece SBS (Special Bonus Section) image shows several panels illustrating reader questions and Oda's answers.  One panel depicts a chibi-style illustration of Chopper driving a vehicle. Other panels show close-ups of Luffy's face, Sanji biting a handkerchief in frustration (background detail in chapter 977), and Ulti speaking in a refined manner, prompting a comment from Page One about her speech patterns (chapter 978).  The text focuses on reader questions about Haki, Sanji's reaction, and Ulti's speech, with Oda's responses providing context and explanations.  The image also includes speculation on a potential "Gear 5" for Luffy.
