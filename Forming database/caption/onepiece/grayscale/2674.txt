Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A low-angle, dramatic shot depicts a swordsman wielding a katana against a bright sun and cloudy sky.  The swordsman, whose face is not fully visible, declares "NOT LOSE AGAIN!!" and "I WILL DEFINITELY..."  In the background, several onlookers, possibly his rivals or crewmates, watch. One is partially obscured, while others appear concerned or apprehensive. Text bubbles reveal the swordsman's ambition to defeat a specific opponent and become the strongest swordsman.  The overall mood is intense and determined.
