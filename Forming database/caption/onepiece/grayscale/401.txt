One Piece manga panel depicting a tense discussion between two characters, followed by an action scene.  The first panel shows a heated exchange between a character resembling  a heavily built man with goggles (possibly a captain) and another with spiky hair and a bandana (possibly a subordinate).  The goggle-wearing character suggests collaboration, while the other expresses skepticism.  Subsequent panels show a large, monstrous creature (possibly Komachiyo) being hoisted by several smaller characters up a staircase within a castle, indicated by a floor plan in the last panel. The scene is urgent, with characters urging haste to avoid fire. The focus is on the characters' interactions, the urgent situation, and the location within the castle.
