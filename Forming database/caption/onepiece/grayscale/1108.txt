One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle. A small, straw hat-wearing character (likely Luffy or a similar character) is shown mid-air, swinging a large, jagged, broken sword downwards towards a gigantic bird-like creature. The creature is depicted in a dynamic pose, its feathers and body parts flying as the sword impacts.  Another small character is seen briefly, also seemingly engaged in the fight. The smaller character yells, "You giant bird! Outta my way!"  The scene is filled with action lines and debris suggesting powerful impact and destruction. The background shows a partially visible wooden structure, possibly part of a ship or building, adding context to the setting.
