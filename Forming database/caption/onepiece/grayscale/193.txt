One Piece manga scene depicting a battle.  A swordsman, possibly Zoro, attacks a mechanical device with a powerful slash, creating a large shockwave.  A character, possibly using a Silence-based Devil Fruit ability, creates a sound-canceling sphere, silencing nearby combatants including their captain. The sphere extinguishes all sound within its radius.  The other characters react with shock and inability to speak or hear.  The scene is chaotic and visually intense, showcasing dynamic action lines and expressive character faces.
