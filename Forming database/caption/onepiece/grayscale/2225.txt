This One Piece SBS corner features two questions and answers.  The first shows Usopp, expressing surprise, looking at a map highlighting his gallery's location within Weekly Shonen Jump's New Year's party.  It also showcases a panel from Mizuki Yoda's *neO;lation* manga, celebrating its inclusion in the Usopp Gallery. The second question asks for an anthropomorphic depiction of Zoro's three swords (Wado Ichimonji, Kitetsu III, and Shusui). Oda Sensei provides humorous drawings of each sword as human characters.
