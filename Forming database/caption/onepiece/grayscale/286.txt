One Piece manga panel depicting Sanji's wanted poster.  A large, close-up of a surprised, long-nosed man holding the poster shows Sanji ("Black Leg" Sanji) with a bounty of 330,000,000 Berries.  Nearby, onlookers react with shock and fear.  In a smaller panel above, Sanji is seen making an impressive speech while two other figures observe, one appearing to be a geisha.  The overall scene suggests a moment of revelation and impending danger for Sanji.
