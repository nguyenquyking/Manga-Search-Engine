One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between Monkey D. Luffy and Jibuemon.  The scene shows a ruined Wano country, with factories polluting the air and a barren landscape.  Jibuemon, a retainer of the Kozuki clan, identifies himself and confirms Luffy's identity as Lord Kozuki Momonosuke.  The dialogue reveals that the Kozuki name has been scorned, and that Jibuemon has waited 20 years for Luffy's arrival. The panel also shows a group of people in the background, possibly other retainers of the Kozuki clan.  Visual elements include dilapidated buildings, smoke-filled skies, and a generally desolate environment.
