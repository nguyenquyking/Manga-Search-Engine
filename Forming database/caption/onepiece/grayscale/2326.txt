One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Hawkins is attacked by an unseen assailant ("Get Lost, Hawkins!"), while other characters observe.  A large group of figures on horseback rides away from a Japanese-style building, creating a sense of urgency.  Basil Hawkins is shown reacting to the attack and the actions of others.  Zoro (Roronoa Zoro) is shown observing from a distance.  Another character (likely a Straw Hat, though not clearly identified) speculates on the power of another character, and the possibility of an alliance ("That Power...!!", "It is possible...They had an alliance, after all!!").  The scene emphasizes strategic maneuvering and the power dynamics among the characters.
