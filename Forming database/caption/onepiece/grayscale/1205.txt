One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, monstrous figure is shown in the top left panel, possibly a creature or an enemy.  In the top right, a male character with dark hair and a stern expression reacts, possibly to the creature's attack. The middle section shows the aftermath of a fight, with a figure lying on the ground, apparently defeated.  A sword lies near. Two other figures stand nearby, one in dark robes, the other in lighter clothing, possibly observing the scene.  The bottom section shows three close-ups of characters' faces expressing shock and anger, with the name "IZO" mentioned prominently. The overall scene suggests a fierce battle has taken place, with a possible death or serious injury. The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga art style.
