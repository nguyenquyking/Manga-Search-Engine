One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Luffy, carrying Tama, leaps away from a rooftop battle.  A large, angry man, possibly  Kamijiro, confronts them, while another character, possibly Zoro, engages in a sword fight on the ground.  A dog-like creature is present, and a third character, potentially Franky, points and directs a dog.  The scene is filled with action lines and onomatopoeia indicating impact and movement.
