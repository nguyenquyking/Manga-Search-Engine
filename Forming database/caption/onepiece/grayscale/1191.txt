One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large dragon-like creature's mouth is shown in the top panels, with "OHHH...!!" indicating awe or fear.  The central panel shows a group of samurai firing weapons at a platform launched into the air, marked with "BORDERS!!!".  Text bubbles exclaim "OPEN WANO'S..." and "FWOOM".  The bottom panel shows three characters:  a stern-faced man, seemingly an antagonist, who declares that the samurai's actions will be remembered and that their mistake shouldn't be repeated,  and two jubilant samurai celebrating, with speech bubbles "WIPE OUT THE NAME OF KOZUKI!!" and "AFTER THEM!!".  The overall scene depicts the opening of Wano's borders, a significant event with both celebration and ominous undertones.
