One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with several characters from the Kyoshiro Family.  Kaku and Kuni (and Suke) are prominently featured, explaining to another character (likely Luffy) the necessity of paying respect to the family to operate a business in their territory.  Luffy, displaying a nonchalant attitude, asserts his toughness and disregards their concerns.  The scene involves dialogue about business dealings and territorial rights within the Kyoshiro Family's domain.  Visual elements include the family members' distinct clothing and the use of onomatopoeia ("BEING") to emphasize the family's presence and authority.
