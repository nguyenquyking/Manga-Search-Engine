One Piece manga panel depicting three men discussing the quality of noodles and judging people based on their clothing.  One man, seemingly the leader, confidently asserts that only those of "proper status and palate" can appreciate their superior noodles. He and another man observe a third, commenting on his appearance and suggesting that he is an "easy mark" due to his clothes. The leader smokes a cigarette while making condescending remarks about those deemed unworthy of the high-quality noodles.  The scene is set in a simple, rustic interior.
