One Piece manga panel depicting a humorous scene.  Three characters, attempting to build a campfire, inadvertently mimic the poses of the Three Admirals.  The first panel shows a large, uncontrolled fire. The second panel shows three individuals striking the signature Admiral poses; two with their arms outstretched and one in a slightly different posture. The bottom panels show a smaller, controlled fire, with three figures mimicking the admirals again from a slightly different perspective. The text indicates the attempted campfire's failure and the resulting imitation.  The scene is lighthearted and comedic.
