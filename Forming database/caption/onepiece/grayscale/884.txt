One Piece manga panel depicting a battle between Zoro and a heavily armored opponent. Zoro, using his "Three Sword Style: Purgatory," attacks with a powerful downward slash,  "Be-heading Claws,"  against his opponent who is shown partially obscured, but appears to be using a defensive technique.  The opponent's speech bubble indicates a counterfactual scenario where Zoro would have been killed if the opponent had used their "Punishers" technique.  The intense action is emphasized by motion lines and impact effects.  The panel highlights Zoro's offensive maneuver, "Oni Giri," and the fierce nature of the combat.
