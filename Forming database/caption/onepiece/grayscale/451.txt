One Piece manga color spread depicting Sanji observing a large, monstrous, golden-yellow creature attacking Sanji.  Sanji exclaims "Sanji!! Look Ouuuut!!"  The creature, seemingly a transformed or awakened Sanji, reacts with pain ("Ouch!") when struck by a large sword.  The scene shows a powerful, destructive battle; the surroundings are heavily damaged.  In other panels, a blonde-haired character, possibly Sanji himself but in a different form, expresses frustration and disbelief at the transformation ("What the hell is with my body?!", "I don't want to be a monster too!", "This sucks!!").  The overall scene suggests a struggle against a powerful awakened ability.
