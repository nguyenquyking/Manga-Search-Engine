One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring fan questions and Oda's responses.  Panel 1 shows chibi-style drawings of Zolo biting his sword, explaining that he does so to honor a promise and channel his friend's sorrow into strength. Panel 2 depicts Sanadacchi admitting to using water escape in Chapter 935's bathhouse scene. Panel 3 shows a chibi Sanada as a comedic contrast to the emotional previous section.  The text focuses on Zolo's sword-biting habit, Sanadacchi's bathhouse escapade, and Oda's intentional use of placeholders after emotional chapter endings to avoid jarring comedic relief.
