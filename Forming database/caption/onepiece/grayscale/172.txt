A dramatic One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle between Kaido (in his dragon form) and a shadowy, red-clad figure.  Kaido's powerful attack creates a massive explosion.  Smaller panels show  the worried faces of Momonosuke and Luffy reacting to the scene. Text includes "CPO?!," "MOMO?!," "FATHER!!," and exclamations of shock and surprise. The artist's signature, "GREIISH," is visible throughout.
