One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a character experiences a vision of the future showing the destruction of a traditional Japanese-style building.  The vision is accompanied by sound effects suggesting impact and breaking. Another character, appearing as an older man with long hair and possibly a kimono, reacts to the vision with shock.  A third character, seemingly younger with curly hair, is startled and questions the older man.  The vision foretells "The Shogun," suggesting an impending event related to this figure.  Visual elements include traditional Japanese architecture, sound effect bubbles, and distressed character expressions.
