One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Luffy's forces are engaged in intense combat.  Several characters are shown reacting to events, including expressions of determination, fear, and surprise.  Panels show the use of a "ripe-ripe jutsu," a submarine sinking, and a large-scale fight with multiple swordsmen.  Text bubbles indicate excitement, determination ("to win!!", "don't give up the fight!!"), and the statement "Luffy is going...". The scene is dynamic and action-packed.  Specific character identification is difficult due to the small size and density of the panel.
