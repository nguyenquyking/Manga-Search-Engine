One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character resembling Yamato,  with flame-like hair, uses a technique called "Scourge" against a large, canine-like creature. The creature retaliates with powerful claws and a forceful blow.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia (e.g., "Glare," "Baa," "Koom," "Shwing") indicating intense clashes.  Another smaller character, possibly a member of the Tobiroppo, is shown in an earlier panel being attacked by the creature. The overall visual style is characteristic of One Piece's energetic and expressive art.
