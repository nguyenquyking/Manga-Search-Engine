One Piece manga scene depicting Zoro and Franky.  A large, shadowy figure resembling a Grim Reaper is shown, its scythe creating a vortex. Zoro is seemingly paralyzed, while Franky struggles to move, possibly due to the Reaper's influence.  Text bubbles indicate Zoro's concern for Franky's condition and Franky's struggle to move. A map inset shows the location: Rightbrain Tower, under the dome.
