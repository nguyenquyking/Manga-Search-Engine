One Piece manga scene depicting a fierce battle.  Queen, a member of the Tobiroppo, uses his Bullet Triceratops attack, a powerful projectile, against an opponent.  The opponent, whose face is obscured, utilizes shoulder-mounted rockets for defense.  Queen shouts "Liar!!" and "Shut up!! The more room I have to speed up...", indicating aggressive action and disregard for his opponent.  The scene is dynamic, showing intense energy and movement from both attacks and the resulting explosions.  The text also indicates the acquisition of "Runway Space," which likely refers to a strategic advantage gained by Queen.
