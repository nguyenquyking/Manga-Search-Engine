One Piece manga panel depicting a intense battle scene.  A heavily armored character, possibly a cyborg, is shown unleashing a powerful explosion,  labeled "DOOM!!!" and "Memories!!!". Another character, seemingly injured, reacts with the sound effect "GWUEH!!!".  Simultaneously, a dialogue between two other characters unfolds. One character requests to be killed, while the other, seemingly Straw Hat Luffy,  accepts the request while smoking a cigarette. The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and smoke, highlighting the intensity of the combat.  The overall tone suggests a climactic moment in the narrative.
