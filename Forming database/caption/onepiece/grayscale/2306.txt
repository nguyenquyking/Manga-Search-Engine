Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga image:  Tama, riding on a large, animal-like creature, waves goodbye.  Luffy, in traditional Japanese clothing, stands with other Straw Hat Pirates near a shop labeled "Wander,"  observing Tama's departure.  The scene depicts a farewell, possibly after Tama's escape from a situation involving dumplings.  A large, lion-dog creature is also present. The overall tone is lighthearted and action-oriented.
