One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A large, matronly figure with elaborate headwear shouts "Evacuate! Abandon posts!!" as panicked individuals flee.  Text indicates an "unpredictable disaster."  In a separate panel, Luffy and another character (likely a subordinate) react. Luffy comments on the deliciousness of "Oshiruko," expressing sympathy for the matronly figure's distress. The overall scene suggests imminent danger and widespread panic.
