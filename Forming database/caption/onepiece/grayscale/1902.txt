One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Monkey D. Luffy.  The segment addresses fan questions about the naming conventions of Navy Admirals, specifically focusing on Vice Admiral Nay Mingheim.  A reader inquires about the possibility of a body within the Navy responsible for naming admirals.  The answer confirms that many Navy members have nicknames given by the same person, not just admirals.  A second question discusses Izo, the 16th division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, and his connection to the Akazaya Nine and Kozuki Oden.  The response explains that Izo's appearance in the flashback scene, his attire, and a note in Volume 82 clarify his role and relationship to other characters.  Images of several Navy Admirals, Izo, and the Akazaya Nine are included.
