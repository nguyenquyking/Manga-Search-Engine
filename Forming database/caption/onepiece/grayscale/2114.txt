One Piece manga panel depicting Orochi, the shogun, and his followers.  Orochi is shown reacting with fear and disbelief to something unseen, while his followers laugh at him. The scene takes place in a Japanese-style building.  The text bubbles reveal Orochi's belief in the legend and his followers' lack of seriousness, contrasting with his own fear.  The laughter directed at Orochi is a clear point of visual and narrative conflict.
