One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Sanji, visibly distressed, is shown with his neck broken by a sword.  Queen, identifiable by her distinctive appearance and speech bubbles, is present. Other characters, possibly Queen's subordinates, are also shown reacting to the situation.  Sanji experiences a transformation, as indicated by his internal monologue ("What's happening to my body?") and the surrounding visual effects. The scene takes place amidst rubble and a partially destroyed building, suggesting a fight. The overall mood is tense and dramatic.
