One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Drake, a large, heavily built man with a stitched-up torso and mechanical arm, confronts a figure (possibly Trafalgar Law, though not explicitly named) who let Law escape.  Another character, seemingly a superior officer, expresses anger and disappointment about the escape.  The scene unfolds in a ruined location.  Dialogue reveals accusations and questions about the escape and the motivations of the involved parties.  The overall tone is one of conflict and accusation.
