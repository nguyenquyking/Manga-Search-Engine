One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two powerful characters.  Linlin, with horns and a fierce expression, threatens violence.  Another character, with a large, grotesque face and wide grin, suggests reconciliation, saying "C'mon, let's just get along...like old times!!!"  A smaller panel shows a third character, possibly observing, and claims ownership of the Straw Hat's head.  The overall scene showcases tension and conflicting intentions between the main characters.
