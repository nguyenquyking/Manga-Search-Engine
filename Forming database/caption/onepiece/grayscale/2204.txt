One Piece manga scene depicting frantic loading of large stone blocks onto ships.  Luffy and another character (possibly Zoro) are shown straining, shouting "Do on!", while another character apologizes for slow progress.  A supervisor notes approximately 500 stones have been moved.  A subsequent panel shows concern over the prisoners' strength even with sea prism stone cuffs.  The scene emphasizes physical exertion and the large-scale operation of moving stones.
