A severely injured man, possibly Zoro, lies on a wooden floor, clutching his wounded face.  Blood splatters are visible on his shirt and the floor. A large, serrated blade is partially visible, suggesting a recent attack.  He is screaming and a speech bubble above him proclaims "I WILL NEVER LOSE AGAIN!!" The scene is intense and depicts significant physical trauma.
