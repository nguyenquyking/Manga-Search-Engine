One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Sasaki, a member of Kaido's Tobiroppo, is shown amidst a large-scale conflict.  She is visibly distressed, breathing heavily ("Huff, Huff...").  Franosuke is also present, expressing surprise ("What?!").  A giant armored mecha-like unit is advancing, causing alarm ("Yikes, Look Out!!").  In the background, the remnants of a destroyed landscape with scattered debris indicate extensive damage.  A text bubble reveals that a significant portion of Sasaki's Armored Division has been overwhelmed ("You've really made a mess of things here!!").  Another panel shows a close-up of a character's fierce expression, shouting "Hacha Cha Cha!!". The overall scene suggests intense fighting and significant losses for Sasaki's forces.
