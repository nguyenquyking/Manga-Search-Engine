One Piece manga panel depicting a powerful attack.  A large, horned figure (likely a Minotaur-like character) powerfully smashes through a stone floor, causing a significant explosion of debris.  A woman with glasses yells "GRAMMAR!" in the background, seemingly observing the destruction. Another woman is shown at the bottom of the stairs, observing the scene.  The horned figure shouts "CUT THAT OUT!!" indicating a forceful action. The overall scene depicts intense destruction and chaos.  The onomatopoeia suggests the impact and force of the attack.
