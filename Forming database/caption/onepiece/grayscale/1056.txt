One Piece manga panel depicting a flashback.  Momonosuke, dangling over an edge, is saved by someone running towards him.  Another character, seemingly observing, expresses regret at not being able to help sooner.  A later panel shows a powerful, fast movement ("Voom!") suggesting a rescue attempt. The overall scene illustrates a past perilous situation for Momonosuke and the emotional aftermath.
