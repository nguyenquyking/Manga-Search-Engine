One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene. A female character, possibly Nami, is attacked by a viscous, dark substance emanating from an unseen source.  The substance covers her lower body.  In a subsequent panel, one of her legs is shown returning to its normal form. The expressions of the characters indicate surprise and distress. Speed lines and onomatopoeia emphasize the action and impact.  The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a room with a bookshelf visible in the background.
