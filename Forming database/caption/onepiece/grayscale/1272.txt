One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Chopper at ages 40 and 60.  At age 40, Chopper is shown saying "Leave this one to me!!" and at age 60, he's offering medicine, stating "It'll work on everything—even losers!"  A younger Chopper is depicted in a different future scene, seemingly distressed, with text stating "Straw Hat? Don't ever say that name again."  A final panel shows an older, more menacing Chopper labeled "Poison," with the instruction "Bring out the sacrifice!!!"  The section also includes a question and answer regarding the Gifters' transformations and their unstable abilities.
