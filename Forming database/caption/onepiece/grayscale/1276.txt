One Piece manga panel depicting Orochi, a large, imposing figure with dark hair and a beard, reacting to news about the defeat of Momonosuke.  He reminisces about Momonosuke's father, Oden, and his disappointment in Momonosuke.  Other characters present include a woman in a kimono (likely Hiyori) who observes the scene calmly, and Kanjuro, who is being celebrated with a toast by Orochi.  Momonosuke is shown defeated and deemed a "brat" by Orochi.  The scene is set in a Japanese-styled room. The overall mood is one of triumph and scorn from Orochi towards Momonosuke and his lineage.
