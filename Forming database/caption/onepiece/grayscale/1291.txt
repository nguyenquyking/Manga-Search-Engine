One Piece manga scene depicting a dramatic moment.  A large, complex mechanical structure is breaking apart, with rocks flying.  In the foreground, Eustass Kid, identifiable by his distinctive horned hat and cybernetic enhancements, is shown amidst the destruction.  Other characters, possibly members of his crew, are reacting with shock and alarm ("What happened, Apoo?!", "Hey!! That guy's not one of ours!!!").  The overall scene suggests a powerful attack or unexpected event, highlighting Kid's involvement and the chaotic aftermath.
