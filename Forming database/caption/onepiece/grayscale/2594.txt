One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A woman cries, seemingly heartbroken.  Luffy (implied by context, not explicitly shown) is mentioned as his crew departs.  A large-scale naval battle unfolds with numerous ships and explosions ("Daboom," "Boom").  A large, monstrous figure commands his crew to "Hold Fast!!!"  The narrative focuses on love, loss, and a consequential battle, with the outcome yet to be determined.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
