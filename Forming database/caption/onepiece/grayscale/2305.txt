One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy, Speed, and Horselina.  Luffy commands Speed to take Horselina away.  Horselina, carrying a small child on her horse, is reluctant. Speed, a member of the Animal Kingdom Pirates, declares he owes Luffy no favors but is nonetheless following his orders.  The scene includes dialogue boxes revealing the characters' thoughts and feelings, including Horselina's loyalty to her master and a child's gratitude for saved apples.  A secondary panel shows Luffy interacting with another character, possibly discussing a sword. The overall setting appears to be outdoors, near a temple-like structure.
