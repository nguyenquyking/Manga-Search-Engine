Big Mom, riding a Sharkygator, is in the Wasteland of Kuri.  She comments on the people of Okobore Town being nice, despite their poverty.  A small figure, possibly a member of her crew, is shown near her.  Text bubbles indicate Big Mom's interactions and thoughts. The scene also features another character, potentially a subordinate, who is scolded by Big Mom for drooling.  The overall tone is lighthearted despite the setting.
