In the top panel, Luffy uses a pistol against a large, angry man with long, flowing hair, while another character with a sword attacks from the side. In the subsequent panels, Luffy is shown grappling with a large lizard-like creature, actively fighting it off,  displaying dynamic movement and expressions of effort and determination.  The overall scene is chaotic, filled with motion lines indicating fast-paced action and attacks.  Sound effects like "CHOMP," "ZWOOP," "GRANK," and "HSS" enhance the dynamic energy.
