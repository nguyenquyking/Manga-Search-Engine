A chaotic scene unfolds in a One Piece manga panel.  Ussop is shown beaten and lying on the ground, possibly after being attacked.  Another woman, possibly Nami, is also shown injured and defeated.  A large, powerfully built character, likely a member of the enemy force, is running through a destroyed Japanese-style building.  This character yells "Hey!! Woman!!"  Another character, possibly Luffy or another Straw Hat, is shown surrendering and stating "I've lost!! I surrender!!". The overall atmosphere suggests a battle has just concluded, with the Straw Hats seemingly defeated.  The visual elements include crumbling buildings, smoke, and onomatopoeia representing impact and movement.
