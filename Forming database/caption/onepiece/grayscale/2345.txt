One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Luffy, on the right, is engaged in a confrontation with a figure on a rooftop, who is yelling triumphantly.  Luffy is shown expressing anger and debt related to a destroyed house.  The lower panel shows Miss Speed, a tall slender woman in a revealing outfit, standing amidst a group including several samurai-like figures and a large amount of fruit and other goods.  The scene suggests a post-battle or raid scenario with multiple characters interacting in a busy, market-like setting.
