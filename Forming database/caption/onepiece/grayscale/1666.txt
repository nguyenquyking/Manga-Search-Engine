One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of distraught samurai reacting to a catastrophic event.  Several characters express their grief and despair.  The scene shows a wrecked ship in stormy seas, indicating a recent disaster.  Speech bubbles reveal their desperation: they plead to avoid further shame, lament the loss of loved ones (including a wife), and question their future.  One character mentions Lord Oden's impact on their lives.  The overall mood is one of profound loss and regret.  The visual style is characteristic of One Piece, with exaggerated expressions and dramatic use of shading.
