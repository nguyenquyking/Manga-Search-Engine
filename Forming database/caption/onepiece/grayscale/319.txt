One Piece manga panel depicting a fast-paced battle.  Kaido, in his hybrid dragon form, performs a "Bird Dance" attack, his body blurred by speed, impacting the ground with considerable force creating a large explosion.  Another character, seemingly a swordsman, attempts to attack but is too slow, as indicated by the text "He's fast!!"  The swordsman's attack is shown in a previous panel, where they state they can cut him.  The overall scene is dynamic and showcases Kaido's overwhelming speed and power.
