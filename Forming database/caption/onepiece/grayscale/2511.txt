One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  A large, Marine-affiliated man, possibly a high-ranking officer, dominates the upper panel, eating a large meal while conversing with Hina, a female naval officer.  The conversation centers around the era of Roger and Rox, implying a discussion about past powerful pirates.  Other Marine personnel are present at the table, listening to the conversation. The lower panel shows a close-up of an older, possibly higher-ranking Marine officer, looking concerned, and Hina, who appears worried. The dialogue highlights concerns about the potential return of powerful figures and the growing strength of unnamed pirates.
