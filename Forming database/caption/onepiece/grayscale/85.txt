A wounded young woman, possibly a fighter, is depicted leaning against an ornate, possibly metallic, pole.  She is wearing a short, pleated skirt and a sleeveless top. Her face shows signs of injury and distress. The background features a decorative, Art Nouveau-style design with flowers and swirling patterns. The scene suggests a post-battle scenario or a moment of vulnerability.  The overall style is reminiscent of manga.
