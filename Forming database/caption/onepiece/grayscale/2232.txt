One Piece manga panel depicting several scenes.  The first shows Otsuru, still beautiful after 20 years, comforting an elderly man, possibly Oden.  They discuss food and the town's safety. The second panel shows a large figure, possibly Ashura Doji, impacting the ground. The third shows a town, possibly under attack, with a figure on a bull. The final panel shows a woman relieved to know someone is safe, with a distant view of a town and what appears to be industrial structures in the background.  Key characters include Otsuru and possibly Ashura Doji.  The overall theme is reunion, relief, and possibly the aftermath of an attack.
