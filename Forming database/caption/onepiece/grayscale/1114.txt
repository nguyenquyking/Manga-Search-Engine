One Piece manga panel depicting a large, spherical, flame-like fruit (likely a Devil Fruit) being held.  Several characters are shown interacting.  A female character with short hair and glasses urges someone to eat the fruit, while a male character with a straw hat looks surprised.  Another male character, seemingly distressed, is also present. The dialogue boxes indicate urgency and disagreement about consuming the fruit.  The scene suggests a desperate situation where the fruit's consumption is crucial.
