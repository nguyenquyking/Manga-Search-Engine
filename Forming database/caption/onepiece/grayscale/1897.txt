One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between Ashura and another character (possibly a samurai).  Ashura is asked to join a fight against an enemy. The plan involves freeing samurai imprisoned for bearing moon tattoos, leveraging their support to attack Onigashima during the Fire Festival. Lord Yasui's sacrifice to divert enemy attention is mentioned. The scene shifts to show a group of samurai, possibly including Ashura, and a large, possibly mythical creature near a torii gate, suggesting a journey or preparation for battle.
