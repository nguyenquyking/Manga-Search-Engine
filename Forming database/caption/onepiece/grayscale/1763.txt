One Piece manga panel depicting a snowy scene in Ringo.  A hooded figure in a kimono is shown repeatedly stomping through the snow,  text indicating this is the "Present Day, Ringo". Another character, seemingly injured, is seen walking through the snowy, ruined landscape, questioning their location. A third character, possibly Zoro, is shown close up,  looking determined and following bloodstains.  The overall scene suggests a chase through a snowy, post-battle environment.
