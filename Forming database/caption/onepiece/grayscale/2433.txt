One Piece manga panel depicting Monkey D. Luffy in a wild, polluted landscape.  The background shows an industrial wasteland with smoke stacks.  Luffy observes a boar, a tiger, and a shark-odile.  Text bubbles indicate the animals' actions ("Stomp," "Growl," "Snork") and Luffy's reaction ("Wow, this place is so wild!").  Another text bubble states, "...A Waste-Land!!"  The scene is chaotic and emphasizes the untamed nature of the environment.
