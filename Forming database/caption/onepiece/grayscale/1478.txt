One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A large, dragon-like figure addresses a group, criticizing their past actions, specifically mentioning  Newgate and Roger's contrasting approaches. The speech focuses on a lack of decisiveness and dignity.  One character, seemingly defiant, is shown in the bottom right panel.  Another character, possibly a leader, is shown in the bottom left panel. The visual style is typical of One Piece manga, with dramatic linework and expressive character faces.  The dialogue highlights themes of reputation, sacrifice, and leadership.
