One Piece manga panel depicting several characters.  A muscular, shirtless man with long hair, possibly Ace, is exclaiming "I WILL WRITE THE GREATEST ADVENTURE BOOK EVER!!",  holding a piece of fruit. Another character, possibly a female shipwright, with a determined expression asks, "WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO HELP YOU BUILD ANOTHER SHIP!?"  A third character, possibly Luffy, is seen eating the fruit and commenting on its taste.  The scene shows emotional intensity and a focus on building a ship.
