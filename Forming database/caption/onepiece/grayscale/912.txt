A manga panel depicting a character, seemingly Sanji (based on his appearance and style), slicing a large object with incredible speed.  His blonde hair, striped shirt, and tie are visible. The action is emphasized by motion lines and the onomatopoeia "SLICE" indicating a sharp, clean cut.  The scene suggests a dynamic, powerful attack.
