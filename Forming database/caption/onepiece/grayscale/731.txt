One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Luffy, grinning widely and panting ("Huff!!"), faces off against a large, monstrous figure with horns and reptilian features.  Another character, possibly a subordinate, is shown launching an attack in the background. The monstrous figure's expression is one of malicious glee.  The text indicates that the more precarious the situation, the bigger Luffy's smile becomes. The setting appears to be a rocky, desolate landscape.  The overall mood is intense and action-oriented.
