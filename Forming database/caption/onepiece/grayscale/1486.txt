One Piece manga panel depicting a violent confrontation.  Momo is being attacked, crying out "Father!".  A large, muscular figure engages in intense combat, possibly against Kaido (implied by the panel's style and context).  Blood splatter is visible. Another character, possibly a younger individual, witnesses the scene with a horrified expression. The sound effects emphasize the impact and violence of the action.  The overall scene suggests a desperate struggle and significant danger.
