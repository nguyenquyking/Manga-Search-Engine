One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where two characters react to the appearance of Germa 66's Stealth Black.  One character, a woman with long hair, exclaims, "The real thing?!"  Another character, partially obscured, remarks, "That's Germa 66's..."  A figure, presumably Stealth Black, is shown kneeling in the background. The overall mood is one of surprise and possibly apprehension.
