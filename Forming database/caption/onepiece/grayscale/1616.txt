One Piece manga panel depicting a tense scene.  A large, scowling man, likely a high-ranking official, explains the strict rules of the location: no one is allowed to leave, and those who try will be killed.  A samurai is present, causing tension.  Elsewhere in the panel, a group, possibly including Oden, is shown engaged in battle, with a battle cloud visible on a mountain in the distance.  Other characters are shown rushing to find Oden.  The overall mood is one of impending conflict and urgency.
