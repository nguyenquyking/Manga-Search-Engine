One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A large, muscular man, possibly Kaido, angrily criticizes a crew, calling them a joke and lamenting their actions.  Other characters, including Luffy (with visible injuries), Nami, and potentially Zoro, react with varying expressions of anger, confusion, and concern.  The spilled Oshiruko is mentioned, suggesting a key plot element.  The scene is tense and filled with dialogue bubbles expressing frustration and disbelief.
