One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two swordsmen.  A sharply dressed man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a striped shirt and tie, holds two swords, one in each hand, boasting about their length and sharpness.  He addresses another swordsman, partially visible in the lower panel, calling him a "stupid swordsman". The second swordsman appears to be shorter and has similar light-colored hair.  The scene emphasizes the first swordsman's confidence and skill with his weapons.  The word "Perfect" highlights his self-assuredness.
