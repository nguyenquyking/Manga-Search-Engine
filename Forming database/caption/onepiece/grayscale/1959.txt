One Piece manga panel depicting a scene at Komurasaki's public funeral.  A high-ranking official, possibly a Shogun, orders Komurasaki's death to be made an example, using light scrolls to publicize it nationwide.  Kyoshiro, seemingly loyal, has already prepared the scrolls.  The official expresses concern about unrest if everyone gathers, emphasizing the irony of the city's two biggest stars dying together.  The scene shows preparations for a ritual funeral, with the official intending to attend, and a large building, possibly a temple or palace, in the background.
