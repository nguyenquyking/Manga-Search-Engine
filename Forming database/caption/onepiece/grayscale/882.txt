One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation between Trafalgar Law, Luffy's henchman, and two other unnamed characters.  Law dismisses the other two as losers, provoking a response.  A female character, possibly Big Mom, unleashes a "Heavenly Bon-Bons" attack, while Prometheus, a fire homie, is commanded to burn the opponents.  The scene ends with a challenge: the first to react loses.  The visual elements include speech bubbles, action lines, and expressions reflecting anger, frustration, and determination.
