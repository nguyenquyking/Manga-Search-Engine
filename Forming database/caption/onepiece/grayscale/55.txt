One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two female characters.  One, in a short skirt and top, wields a staff-like weapon. The other, in a black, form-fitting dress and fishnet stockings, appears to be countering her attack. The background features an ornate, decorative pattern.  Text bubbles indicate an attack ("SHAVE!") and a dismissive comment ("NO HARD FEELINGS"). A close-up shows a character's eye being struck.  Character names are not explicitly shown in this image.
