One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Eiichiro Oda.  A reader, Buchonosuke, inquires about a seemingly floating roof over a sumo ring in Wano, which Oda reveals is a kite. Another reader, Takashi, points out a banner mentioning "Mougan Ono-zeki," possibly referencing Axe-Hand Morgan from Chapter 4, leading Oda to explain that his assistant handles background details, including hidden references.  The image includes sketches of Oda and his assistant, a panel depicting the Wano sumo scene, and a close-up of a banner.
