One Piece manga scene depicting a catastrophic event.  A large fiery explosion dominates the center panels, with debris and destruction surrounding it.  Multiple characters react to the devastation:  a masked woman (possibly a geisha) is shown playing a stringed instrument, appearing distressed.  Other characters, including Luffy (likely injured and on the ground), and Roronoa Zoro are shown amongst the ruins. An older, large figure with a gaping mouth reacts with a cough. The overall tone suggests a significant consequence stemming from a powerful event, possibly related to the "Great Pirate Era".  The dialogue boxes express shock, anger, and regret.  The final panel shows a dark chasm and the question, "Are you listening, Roger?", suggesting a connection to the legendary pirate.
