She appears to be fighting a heavily armored opponent, who is shown executing a "V-for-Victory Flash" attack. The armored opponent comments on Nami's bleeding stomach wound. The final panel shows Nami, struggling against this powerful opponent, lamenting her poor sword fighting skills.  The scene is set against a backdrop of urban destruction and rubble.
