One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with several characters and actions.  A large, monstrous figure, possibly a zoan-type Devil Fruit user, roars, labeled "Boss Cat Viper".  Smaller characters are present, possibly Nami, reacting to the scene.  The moon is visible, and text indicates it's out, impacting the scene somehow. Another panel shows a sea creature, possibly a sea king, sinking, with text referencing a journal entry.  A final panel shows a flashback of a past battle, possibly involving Whitebeard and Roger, as indicated by the text. The overall scene is chaotic and suggests a powerful force at play.
