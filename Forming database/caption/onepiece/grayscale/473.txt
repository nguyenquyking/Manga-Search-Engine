One Piece manga panel depicting a battle between two dragons.  Kaido's Azure Dragon is facing off against a pink dragon ridden by a pirate.  Luffy, identified as "Straw Hat Luffy," observes the scene with concern, expressing a wish to help.  Another panel shows a character (possibly Yamato) distracting Kaido.  A third character, whose identity is unknown, observes, noting the unknown identity of the pink dragon.  The overall scene is chaotic and depicts a large-scale battle.
