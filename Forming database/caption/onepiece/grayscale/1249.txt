One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of chaos and urgency aboard a ship, possibly the Thousand Sunny.  Large waves crash against the vessel as it is submerged.  The crew is reacting to the sudden influx of water and snow.  Text bubbles indicate actions like "Close the hatch!!" and "We're going back under!!".  Trafalgar Law is partially visible in one panel, reacting to the snow.  Another panel shows crew members reacting to something falling, possibly debris.  The overall scene suggests a perilous situation at sea. The words "Chambres" are visible, potentially indicating a location on the ship.
