One Piece manga panel depicting Yamato, a female character with large horns and a striped outfit, wielding a large club.  She declares her loyalty, stating she would die for someone (implied to be the person whose father's name was used).  The panel shows a previous explosion ("KABAM!") and another character questioning Yamato's identity. The scene suggests a moment of intense action and revelation, possibly a confrontation or a declaration of allegiance.
