One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  A large, laughing character, possibly Yasue, recounts an event, dismissing it initially as a prank. Another character, seemingly a leader or superior, expresses skepticism but confirms solid intelligence regarding samurai. The scene shows a bridge between Kuri and Udon, a burning castle in the background, and the characters' reactions to the unfolding situation, highlighting disbelief and a serious tone despite the comedic elements.  The final panel emphasizes the seriousness of the information.
