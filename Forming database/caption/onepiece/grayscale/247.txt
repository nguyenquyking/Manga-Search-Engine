One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Luffy is shown being impacted by a powerful attack, indicated by sound effects "DOOM!!" and "GANK!!".  He is screaming in pain ("AAAAH!!!", "RAAAHH!!!").  The attack creates a large, swirling vortex of energy ("DA DA DA DOOM") with debris flying outwards.  Another panel shows Luffy seemingly countering with an attack of his own against a large, dark, possibly monstrous figure.  The scene is chaotic with dynamic action lines emphasizing the force of the attacks and the overall intensity of the fight.
