One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  A character with long, flowing hair (possibly Zoro) is being forcefully pulled away by a large, dark, possibly shadowy figure.  Another character, appearing smaller and possibly antagonistic, is attempting to restrain Zoro.  Speech bubbles indicate a tense interaction; Zoro is expressing urgency and the other is protesting, claiming no harm is intended.  Visual elements emphasize speed and struggle with motion lines and impact sounds. The overall scene suggests a kidnapping or forceful abduction attempt.
