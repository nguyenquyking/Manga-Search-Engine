One Piece manga panel depicting a tense confrontation between two characters.  A masked swordsman (left) faces off against a bandana-wearing swordsman (right, possibly Zoro).  The masked figure states their intention to win the fight by any means necessary. The bandana-wearing swordsman, unimpressed, notes the masked figure's lack of fighting style.  The scene also shows a flashback of Lady Hiyori and Boss Hyogoro, indicating a connection to the current conflict.  The visual style is dynamic, with motion lines and sound effects emphasizing the intensity of the fight.
