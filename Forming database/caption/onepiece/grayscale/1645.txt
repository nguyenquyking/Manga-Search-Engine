One Piece manga panel depicting the "Harem War," initiated by Lord Oden.  The panels show Oden's actions of abducting women, leading to a battle with samurai husbands defending their wives.  The Hyogoro family was also involved in the conflict.  A later panel shows a messenger reporting to someone (possibly a higher authority) about the casualties resulting from Lord Oden's actions, stating that the casualty count is now 18.  The overall tone is one of recounting a historical event within the One Piece universe.
