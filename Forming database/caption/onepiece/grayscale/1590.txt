One Piece manga scene depicting Toki, a woman with dark hair and a flower ornament, requesting refuge.  A large, mustachioed man, possibly Oden, initially refuses but relents.  An enemy attack ensues, shown by ships clashing at sea. The scene then shifts to reveal a stunning, unique city architecture, causing astonishment among the characters. The city's style is remarkably different from anything previously seen.  The overall focus is on Toki's arrival, the ensuing conflict, and the awe-inspiring discovery of a new, unfamiliar city.
