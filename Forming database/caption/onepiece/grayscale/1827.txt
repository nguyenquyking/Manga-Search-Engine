One Piece manga scene depicting Luffy in Udon, Wano.  A large, powerful attack, "The Plague Rounds," is launched, targeting the "meddlesome six." Luffy is shown dodging the attack, while another panel shows him interacting with another character (possibly Zoro) urging them to stop aiming incorrectly.  The background displays the Udon prison landscape.  The overall scene is one of intense action and close calls.
