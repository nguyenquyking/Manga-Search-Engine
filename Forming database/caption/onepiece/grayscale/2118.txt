One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation.  Komurasaki, a woman in traditional Japanese attire, stands defiantly amidst several large, snarling mythical creatures resembling Japanese Baku.  She confronts an unseen antagonist, rejecting their insults and asserting her samurai heritage.  Other panels show chaos unfolding, with the text indicating "Bedlam has arrived!" and characters chasing a woman.  The overall mood is tense and action-packed, set within a palace.
