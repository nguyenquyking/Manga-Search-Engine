One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy's transformation.  A large, monstrous figure, possibly a Zoan form, is shown with text bubbles discussing the "Sun God, Nika," a legendary warrior slaves prayed to for freedom. Luffy, in his transformed state, is shown battling an opponent, expressing desperation ("Save me!"). The narrative explains the slaves' belief in Nika and the endless feeling of imprisonment.
