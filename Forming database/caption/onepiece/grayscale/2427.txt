One Piece manga panel depicting a narrative about a pirate ship washing ashore near a starving village. Villagers tied up the weakened pirates, fearing retribution, but the pirate captain easily escaped.  The captain's only comment was his desire for dessert.  The villagers' food and water were consumed by the pirates for survival.  Ace's group stayed with the villagers for several weeks, and the villagers were stunned that their lives were saved by the pirates.  Otama was particularly fond of the pirates.  The scene includes Luffy's reaction, showing his understanding and a slight smile.  The panel shows a contrast between the desperate situation of the villagers and the nonchalant attitude of the pirate captain.
