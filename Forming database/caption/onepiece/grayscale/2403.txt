One Piece manga scene depicting a battle. Monkey D. Luffy, in his signature straw hat and polka-dotted kimono, charges forward, sword in hand, shouting "Yes I do! I'll slice and dice these fools, verily!! Gum-Gum...".  He confronts several opponents, including Zoro, who is observing a sword, and other samurai.  The scene is chaotic, with several characters engaged in combat, swords clashing, and onomatopoeia indicating the force of the actions.  The focus is on Luffy's aggressive advance and his declaration of intent.
