One Piece manga panel depicting the consequences of consuming a specific artificial strengthening fruit.  Ten people consume the fruit; only one gains its power, while the other nine suffer downsides including the inability to express sadness or anger and the loss of the ability to swim.  A panel shows a group of "waiters," who haven't eaten the fruit yet but anticipate gaining animal powers. The success rate of the fruit is only 10%.  The panel also shows a large industrial-looking machine labeled "SAD," indicating a negative consequence of the imperfect chemical mixture used in the fruit's creation.  The basic fighters of Kaido's Animal Kingdom pirates are separated into three categories.
