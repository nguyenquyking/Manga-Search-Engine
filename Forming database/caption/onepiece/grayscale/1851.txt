One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Multiple figures, seemingly members of the Kappa tribe, are airborne, indicated by motion lines and exclamations of surprise. A large explosion or energy blast is visible at the center, with the text "Yagura Ryuuo!!" suggesting a powerful attack.  Kawamatsu is shown in a separate panel, observing the scene and commenting on the situation and the technique used. Another character is seen reacting with the words "What?!"  The final panel shows a close-up of a sword reflecting light, with text describing the difficulty of the situation as "like swimming against the rapids of the great river".  The overall scene is dynamic and intense, suggesting a battle is taking place.
