One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion about Onigashima, Kaido's base of operations.  The panel shows a group of characters, including a woman with dark hair possibly Nami,  and others, gathered in a damaged building, discussing the logistical challenges of reaching Onigashima, a visible island requiring ships despite being within Wano.  Text boxes explain that Onigashima is the location of a decisive battle, and that Kaido is considered a deity protecting the land. The Fire Festival, a yearly celebration, coincides with the planned battle.
