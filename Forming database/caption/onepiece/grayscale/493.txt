One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A large, monstrous figure is attacked by a smaller character (likely a devil fruit user) who is yelling "Shut up!".  Another panel shows the monstrous figure, seemingly a large ogre or oni, stating that the smaller character has lived alone for years, hopping about rocks and crawling through attics. The smaller character, in response, claims to have friends. A subsequent panel shows the smaller character receiving food and a blanket from another character, possibly a princess. The ogre then reveals that everyone who ever showed favor to them is dead, including samurai.  The final panel shows a reaction from another character.
