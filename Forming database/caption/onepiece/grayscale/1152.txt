One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Hyogoro is shown fallen amidst a destroyed performance stage inside a dome.  A character resembling a Tobiroppo (possibly Tobiroppo member) is seen flying with large black wings.  Two other large, imposing characters, one seemingly a higher-ranking member of the Beast Pirates, discuss the situation, noting the Straw Hats leading prisoners from Udon into battle and questioning the events at the excavation camp.  The panel suggests a significant battle is underway.
