One Piece manga panel depicting the aftermath of a battle.  Linlin is shown defeated, a speech bubble above her reads "...Lost the fight!!!".  Another character, possibly Luffy, is shown lying on the ground,  "Aah!!"  A third character, seemingly Kaido, looks on in shock, stating "Did you sense that too?!".  Jaggy and Traffy are seen celebrating the victory with speech bubbles stating "Jaggy and Traffy won?! That's amazing...".  The scene is chaotic, with debris and impact effects surrounding the defeated Linlin.
