One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  Kyoshiro, a major character, is shown in a powerful attack, his patterned clothing and distinctive hairstyle clearly visible. He is engaged in a fierce sword fight with another character, whose face is partially obscured but whose shocked expression is evident.  The sound effect "KACH-CHING!" emphasizes the impact of the attack.  In smaller panels, a terrified onlooker (likely a female character) and another character recognizing Kyoshiro are shown, with dialogue confirming Kyoshiro's identity ("It's Boss Kyoshiro!!").  The overall style is energetic and action-packed, utilizing speed lines and onomatopoeia to convey the intensity of the fight.
