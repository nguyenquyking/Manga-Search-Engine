One Piece manga panel depicting the aftermath of Tonoyasu's death.  Lord Yasui observes the joyous reaction of his subjects to Tonoyasu's death, expressing confusion at their celebratory response.  The panel shows multiple speech bubbles expressing both laughter and shock.  The scene features a large crowd of people, some in traditional Japanese clothing, reacting to Tonoyasu's death.  One character, seemingly shocked and distressed, states that they did not realize Tonoyasu was crucified until now.  The overall tone is one of stark contrast between the jubilant crowd and the horror of the situation.
