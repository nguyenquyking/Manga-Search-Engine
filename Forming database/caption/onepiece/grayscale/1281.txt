One Piece manga panel depicting multiple characters and a map.  A large, round-faced character says "They better go top speed, cuz we're nearly at the back door!!".  Next to him is a woman with dark hair, saying "I suppose Kitty must have grown up just like Doggy has!". A third character, with a large hat, states "Sounds like he hasn't changed. I just hope he arrives in time, Kappa pa pa!". A map shows a skull and crossbones marking an island accessible only from the entrance due to currents.  Law is shown, expressing a wish for everyone to be there. Kinemon and Denjiro are confirmed to have successfully approached the island from the rear, as planned.  Momonosuke's safety is also mentioned.
