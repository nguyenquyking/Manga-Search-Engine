One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in a Japanese-style building complex.  A character, seemingly from the future, arrives at a treasure repository behind a tower.  Three samurai-like figures react to his arrival.  In a separate panel, a woman cries out "Lord Oden!!" while another character, possibly Lord Oden, is shown with a joyful, tearful expression, implying his return or survival.  The overall scene suggests a reunion of significant importance, possibly involving time travel.
