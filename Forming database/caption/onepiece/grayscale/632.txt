One Piece manga scene depicting a powerful clash.  A large, horned figure unleashes a "Gargoyle Tile Fist" attack, a powerful purple energy blast.  Another character, seemingly surprised, reacts.  Smaller panels show additional characters engaged in combat, including a Fishman using Fishman Karate and a red beast-like creature involved in a separate altercation.  The overall mood is intense and action-packed.  Specific character names are not definitively visible, requiring further context.
