One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  Yamato, in her oni form, is riding a large, patterned snake,  experiencing a powerful impact.  She is shown bracing herself.  Another character, possibly a subordinate or enemy, is shown reacting to the impact with surprise.  In the background, smaller figures are seen tumbling in the snow.  A third character, resembling a large, grinning man possibly  Queen, observes the scene with a curious expression.  The scene is filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia expressing the impact and speed of Yamato's movement.  The overall tone suggests a battle or chase in a snowy environment.
