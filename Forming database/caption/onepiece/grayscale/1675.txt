One Piece manga panel depicting the Fire Festival in the Flower Capital.  A large, jovial man, possibly a festival organizer, enthusiastically announces the festivities.  Other panels show citizens enjoying the festival:  people drinking sake, children asking for candy apples, and women preparing for a dance performance.  One woman is adjusting her hair, while another expresses excitement about the clear sky and full moon.  The overall atmosphere is celebratory and lively.
