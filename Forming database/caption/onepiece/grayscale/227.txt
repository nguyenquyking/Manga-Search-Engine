One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Lord Orochi is shown reacting to an explosion, possibly caused by explosives he was handling,  indicated by speech bubbles that say "Don't touch those explosives!!!" and "Mahoroba!!!".  Another character, possibly a subordinate, is shown reacting with the sound effect "Aahhhr!!" as they are caught in the blast.  Another panel shows a character (possibly Yamato or another female character) being hit by a blast, with the sound effect "Fwoooom!!" and screaming "Aaaaah!!!". The overall scene is one of intense action and explosions.
