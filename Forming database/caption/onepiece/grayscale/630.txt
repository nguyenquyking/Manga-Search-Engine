One Piece manga panel depicting a flashback.  A monstrous, lion-like figure with pink hair, possibly representing Luffy's awakened Devil Fruit form, is shown.  Text reveals ancient slaves believed in a legendary warrior, "Sun God Nika," who would bring laughter and freedom. The lion-like figure's expression reflects this belief.  Other panels show the figure fighting or interacting with smaller, blue-skinned, monstrous figures.  The smaller figures appear to be slaves, desperately clinging to the legend of Nika for salvation.  The overall scene emphasizes the legend's importance to those suffering under cruel conditions.
