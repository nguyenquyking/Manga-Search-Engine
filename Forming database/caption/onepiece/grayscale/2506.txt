One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Sabo at ages 40 and 60.  The image shows four depictions of Sabo: at age 40 (two versions, one in formal attire, one in a top hat), and at age 60 (two versions, one seemingly more serious and one more jovial).  Text indicates Sabo's differing attitudes and circumstances at each age.  A small inset shows a younger Luffy.  The bottom section lists and depicts various members of the Big Mom Pirates, including their names, ages, and familial relations (e.g., Bassquarte, 13th son, age 42; Anana, 39th daughter, age 8).
