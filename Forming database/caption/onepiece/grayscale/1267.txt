One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic action scene.  Luffy is shown in multiple panels, using his Gum-Gum abilities against a large, reptilian creature.  The creature attacks, causing crashes and destruction. Other characters are present but not clearly identifiable. The scene is characterized by intense action, sound effects ("CRASH," "SWISH," "DMP!"), and expressions of fear and determination.  The overall visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga's dynamic action sequences.
