One Piece manga panel depicting two characters reacting to a large quantity of fish.  A blonde woman exclaims about the beauty of the fish, while a man with short, light-colored hair and a cigarette comments on their size and type, speculating if they are "Draconic Super-Fillet Salmon". A large barrel overflowing with the fish is shown, emphasizing their abundance. The scene is dynamic, with onomatopoeia suggesting the movement of the fish.
