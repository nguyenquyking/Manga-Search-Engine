One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A young boy, possibly Momonosuke, is shown crying and fearful,  while a powerful figure, possibly Kaido, stands on a ship's prow, holding what seems to be a small object.  A woman, likely Hiyori, observes the scene with a determined expression.  Kaido declares the Kozuki clan finished.  The scene includes dialogue expressing fear, grief, and determination.  Visual elements include a tall Japanese-style building, a ship, and expressions of intense emotion on characters' faces.  The overall scene suggests a pivotal moment of conflict and loss within the Wano arc.
