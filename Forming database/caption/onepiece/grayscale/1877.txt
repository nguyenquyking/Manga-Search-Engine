One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Top panel shows a large, angry man with dark hair and a stern expression, possibly a warden, stating that communication in Udon prison will fail. Another character, smaller and lighter-skinned, reacts nervously.  The middle panel features a different, sinister-looking man with dark hair and sharp features,  potentially a prisoner named Raizo, being instructed to steal keys. The bottom panel shows Kawamatsu, a fish-man, imprisoned and seemingly injured, while another character enters a building, concerned.  The overall scene takes place within the Udon prison.
