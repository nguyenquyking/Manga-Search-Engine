One Piece manga panel depicting Sanji in a red suit. He is destroying a mechanical device, with text indicating his dormant abilities have been awakened.  He proclaims he won't lose more of himself and will never belong to Germa.  A large, monstrous creature reacts with disappointment, expressing a desire to see Sanji transform.  In the final panel, Sanji, holding a small snail, bids farewell to the women's baths and Germa. The scene takes place in a traditional Japanese-style building, which is partially destroyed by Sanji's actions.
