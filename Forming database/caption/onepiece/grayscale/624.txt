One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A large, fierce-looking character, possibly a Mink, with large fangs and lion-like features, is engaging in combat. He uses a "Finger Pistol" attack, indicated by onomatopoeia.  He is confronting a second character, whose face is partially obscured, who seems to be reacting to the attack with pain. The Mink character's attacks are creating impact effects.  Speech bubbles reveal dialogue about the history of slavery and the Sun Pirates.  The scene is dynamic and action-packed.
