One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Black Maria, with her long hair and oni-like horns, attacks two masked figures, using what appears to be long, ribbon-like weapons.  One masked figure urges another to call for help.  A separate panel shows a character, possibly Chopper or a similar character, reacting with distress, possibly to the masked figures' predicament.  Another character observes the scene, showing concern.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
