One Piece manga panel depicting a series of action sequences.  Top panel shows Shinobu being attacked, a powerful blow impacting the scene. Middle panels show  Luffy reacting with concern, then Shinobu seemingly trapped by crossed, chained poles, with another character (possibly a subordinate) observing.  The bottom panels show a masked figure and a surprised, possibly concerned, older man reacting to an event.  The overall scene suggests a battle with significant impacts and concern for Shinobu's well-being.
