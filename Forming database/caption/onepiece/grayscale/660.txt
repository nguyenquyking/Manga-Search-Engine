One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene. Nami uses her Clima-Tact, a weather-based weapon,  to create a lightning strike, targeting a large, spiky, dark creature.  Ulti, with horns and battle damage, observes.  Otama is nearby, seemingly safe, while another character is impacted by the attack, yelling in pain. The text indicates Nami’s attack is clearing the way for Otama and that Ulti is tough despite being pulverized inside.  The attack is labeled "Green Star," suggesting a special move.  The scene is dynamic, showing the impact of the lightning strike and the characters' reactions.
