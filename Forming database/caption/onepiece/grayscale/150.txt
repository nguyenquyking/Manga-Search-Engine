One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A giant skull-shaped island is partially submerged, with water splashing around it.  Momonosuke is shown lying injured on the ground, groaning in pain.  Another panel shows a close-up of a damaged skull, possibly part of the island.  A character, possibly an Onigashima resident, is shown in the final panel, seemingly reacting to the commotion.  The overall scene suggests a battle or a catastrophic event.  Sound effects emphasize the impact and chaos.
