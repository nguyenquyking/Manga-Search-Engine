One Piece manga scene:  A large, damaged ship lies broken in the water, its deck forming a ramp leading to the ocean.  Two figures stand at the top of this makeshift ramp, one in a dark cloak and one seemingly smaller, holding a sword.  Luffy, in his characteristic straw hat, observes from a smaller vessel below.  A group of  crew members, possibly from Luffy's crew, watch from behind a railing on that vessel.  The scene depicts a dramatic post-battle or conflict situation, with a strong emphasis on destruction and confrontation.
