One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A muscular man, possibly Oden, stands defiantly, katana drawn, amidst a chaotic scene.  He's surrounded by smaller figures, some appearing frightened or distressed, while others laugh menacingly.  A large fish-like creature splashes in the water nearby.  Text bubbles convey dialogue expressing anger, fear, and condemnation of the torment of children.  The overall mood is tense and violent.
