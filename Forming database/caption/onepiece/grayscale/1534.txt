One Piece manga panel depicting a scene at sea. A large, elephant-like creature is visible in the water.  A ship, possibly the Thousand Sunny, is shown in the background.  A character, possibly Luffy, observes the creature, commenting on its unusual nature, noting it is not an island. Another character holds a vivre card, suggesting a means of reaching Zou.  Other panels show conversations between characters referencing the Kozuki clan and pirates, along with a character expressing a strange feeling.  The overall scene suggests a journey toward Zou using the vivre card, and the encounter with a giant creature adds to the mystery.
