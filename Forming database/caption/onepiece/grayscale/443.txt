One Piece manga scene depicting Queen, a powerful All-Star of the Beasts Pirates, in a large, serpentine form.  Queen laughs maniacally ("MWA HA HA HA!") as he takes a powerful kick from an unseen opponent.  Sanji, wearing his black suit, observes, commenting on the need for a better strategy to overcome Queen's strength. Queen prepares a counterattack ("LET ME STASH THE MECHANISMS AND SHOW YOU PURE DINO TERROR!!"), unleashing a powerful blow ("BOOM!!"). The scene is filled with impact sounds and visual effects emphasizing the power of the attacks.
