One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Luffy, using his Gum-Gum abilities, is shown reacting to a lightning strike.  Another character, possibly a member of the enemy crew, is seen in the panel, questioning Luffy's actions ("So you grabbed the lightning, eh?!").  The scene is dynamic, with motion lines indicating the speed of the lightning and Luffy's movement.  Visual elements include electrical effects and onomatopoeia representing the sounds of the lightning and Luffy's actions.
