One Piece manga panel depicting a tense scene in Wano Country.  A powerful, unnamed character (likely an antagonist) is shown in close-up, sweating and stating his impending death.  He expresses a desire for another character to open Wano in his place.  This is shown alongside a wide shot of Wano's cityscape.  Another female character (possibly a protagonist or ally) is shown, distressed,  telling the powerful character that she is already far into a difficult task, implying a battle or trial. The overall scene suggests a critical turning point in the Wano arc, with high stakes and impending conflict.
