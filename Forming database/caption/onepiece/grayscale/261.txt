One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation in a restaurant.  A stern-faced man, possibly a restaurant owner, confronts a customer (Usohachi) and his companion about the quality of noodles served. The owner accuses Usohachi of serving inferior noodles (less than 50% buckwheat flour) compared to the higher quality noodles (80% buckwheat flour) he was served.  The owner demands recompense and threatens to ban them from the Flower Capital.  Another individual, possibly an employee, observes the interaction.  The scene is tense, with dialogue boxes revealing accusations and threats.
