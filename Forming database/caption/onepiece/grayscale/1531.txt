One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  Roger, a large, bearded man, expresses disappointment.  Another character, Sharley, inquires about the birth of a mermaid princess. Neptune, characterized by his glasses and calm demeanor, clarifies that the true target is not a weapon but the people who labeled it as such – specifically, a vast treasure they left behind.  A third character laughs, seemingly unbothered. The scene includes underwater coral and marine life.  The overall theme centers on a prophecy and the upcoming birth of Poseidon, a powerful mermaid.
