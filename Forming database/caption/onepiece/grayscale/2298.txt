One Piece manga panel depicting the Straw Hats' arrival in Wano Country 20 years in the future.  The scene opens with Kin'emon reacting with distress to the sight of aged graves marked with the names of Kozuki Oden, Kozuki Sukiyaki, and Kozuki Momonosuke.  A wide shot showcases a futuristic, industrialized Wano, confirming Lady Toki's time-leaping power.  In a subsequent panel, the Straw Hats (including Nami, Chopper, and possibly others) explore the devastated landscape, expressing their bewilderment at the unfamiliar, altered Wano.  Kin'emon's distraught expression and the stark contrast between the old graves and the modernized city highlight the passage of time and the dramatic changes in Wano.
