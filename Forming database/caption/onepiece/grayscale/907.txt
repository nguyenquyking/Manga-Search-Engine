One Piece manga panel depicting Sanji, frustrated, attempting to fillet a fish.  He comments on the inadequacy of his deba knife (too short) and yanagiba knife (too thin) for the task.  Luffy observes Sanji's struggle, sarcastically commenting on his prior boasting. Sanji needs a knife with length, sharpness, and sturdiness.  The scene is set in a kitchen.
