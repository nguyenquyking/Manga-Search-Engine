One Piece manga panel depicting three scenes.  The first shows a close-up of a man's sinister grin, possibly Luffy, suggesting anticipation or malicious intent.  The second panel displays a large, fast-moving object, possibly a ship or weapon, with "DUN" and "I DID IT!" indicating its impact and a successful action.  The final panel shows an island landscape, labeled "Ruibei's Island," establishing the location for the next day's events.  A woman and a man with a fish on his head are also present in the first panel, likely observing the man's expression.
