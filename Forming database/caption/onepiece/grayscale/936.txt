A One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where numerous small, maid-uniformed figures are submerged in water, seemingly startled or distressed.  Larger, similarly styled figures are also present, appearing drenched.  In the foreground, several children, including Nami, Chopper, Usopp, and Franky (recognizable by their characteristic styles), watch the scene with shocked expressions. The text indicates this is an extra chapter of "Boku to Roboko" and that it's the end.  The overall tone suggests surprise and possibly alarm.
