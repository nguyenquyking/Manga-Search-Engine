One Piece manga scene depicting a dramatic reveal.  A character, seemingly Momonosuke in his dragon form, is shown amidst a crowd reacting with shock and relief.  A man cries, revealing he's passing on the news that Luffy is alive, after previously believing him dead at Kaido's hands.  Another character, a small childlike figure (likely Momonosuke in a smaller form before transforming), holds a frog, prompting a question from a nearby person.  The overall scene emphasizes the emotional impact of Luffy's survival and the revelation of Momonosuke's dragon form.
