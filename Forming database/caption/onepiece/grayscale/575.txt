One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation. Orochi, a large, monstrous figure, is shown in the first panel, issuing orders.  The subsequent panels show a character, likely a samurai, defying Orochi, unleashing a powerful ice attack called "Namuji Glacier Fang," a large wave of ice emanating from their hands.  The samurai is actively working to liberate their country from Orochi's control, which is revealed to be a weapons factory.  The visual elements emphasize the intensity of the conflict, with the ice attack being the focal point of the final panels.
