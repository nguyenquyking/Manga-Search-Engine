One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion about three men: Bingoh (priest and undertaker), Bongoh (lumber seller), and Bungoh (implied to be involved).  They profited from a fire, gouging grieving families and selling overpriced wood.  Their actions were facilitated by bribery.  The narrative focuses on their collective infatuation with Oiran Komurasaki, who recently died.  The scene suggests that Komurasaki may have intentionally caused their financial ruin by accepting extravagant gifts.  The panel includes multiple character portraits and speech bubbles revealing the unfolding story.
