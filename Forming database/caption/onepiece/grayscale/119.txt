One Piece manga panel depicting Kaido's defeat.  The main focus is Kaido, heavily damaged and seemingly falling, with a dragon-like form.  Another character, seemingly Luffy, is shown smiling gleefully in a separate panel, saying "Isn't this fun...". The text "Kaido ?!!" is displayed near Luffy's panel.  The scene shows intense action and destruction. "To be continued!" is present at the bottom.
