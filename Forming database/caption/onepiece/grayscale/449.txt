A close-up shot of a stern-looking male character from One Piece, possibly CP0 agent,  with long dark hair and a goatee, wearing a white top hat and coat. He holds a green orb in his hand.  A speech bubble above him reads "CAPTURE...".  A smaller speech bubble next to an anthropomorphic bird wearing a similar top hat and coat states "...NICO ROBIN!!!". The background suggests a sunset or sunrise.  The overall scene depicts a moment of intent to capture Nico Robin.
