One Piece manga panel depicting Law, Zoro, and other Straw Hats.  Law, in a striped kimono, subtly manipulates a small cylindrical object ("Tap..!"), while Zoro and another crewmate are shown in the background.  Law's dialogue implies a plan to decrease the enemy's numbers while remaining undetected.  A large reptilian creature is also visible in the background.  The scene suggests stealth and strategic maneuvering.
