One Piece manga scene depicting Luffy, visibly frustrated, confronting a large, muscular figure (likely a member of the Beasts Pirates) drinking sake while overlooking Onigashima.  Luffy questions the drinking during their planned feast. The background shows Onigashima and the text indicates a Fire Festival is occurring in the nearby capital city.  The large figure dismisses Luffy's concerns, stating he's having fun.  The scene highlights a contrast between the planned feast and the ongoing festivities, and Luffy's anger at the disruption.
