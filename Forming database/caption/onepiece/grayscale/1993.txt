One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation among several characters.  O-Tsuru, a samurai's daughter, expresses happiness, while discussing the Akazaya Nine with another character (likely Luffy or a close ally).  The panel shows a visual representation of six of the Akazaya Nine: Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, O-Kiku, Dogstorm, and Cat Viper. Three unnamed members are shown silhouetted.  O-Tsuru holds a card depicting a flame symbol, central to the ongoing plot.  The scene also includes a snow-covered building, possibly in Wano Country.  The dialogue focuses on the whereabouts and status of the Akazaya Nine, with O-Tsuru mentioning Kawamatsu, Denjiro, and Ashura Doji as the remaining three.  The overall mood is one of hopeful anticipation and intrigue.
