One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Top panel shows Kin'emon and Kikunojo, high in the air, seemingly falling.  A distressed woman, possibly Komurasaki, is shown separately, gasping for air.  Another panel shows Luffy restrained by a large man in a military-style hat, while others plead for help.  Subsequent panels show a monstrous, skull-like creature emerging from the ground, with multiple characters reacting to its appearance.  One panel shows a large, muscular man identified as "Briscola," seemingly ignoring a request to subdue a child.  A woman with horns, possibly Ulti, is shown giving an order, possibly related to the monster's appearance.  The overall scene is chaotic and emphasizes urgent action and impending danger.  The main focus is the appearance of a large, ominous creature and the characters' desperate reactions.
