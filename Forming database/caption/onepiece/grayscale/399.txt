One Piece manga panel depicting a fiery confrontation.  Sanji, engulfed in flames, shouts "Stop stoking the fire... I'm already white hot!!"  Another character, seemingly an opponent, smirks and says, "You better not die before then!!"  Sanji's attack is labeled "Hell Memories,"  and he is shown striking his opponent. The scene is highly dynamic, with intense fire effects and impact lines.
