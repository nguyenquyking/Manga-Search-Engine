Black Clover manga chapter:  A Black Bulls pirate crew, led by a gleeful Asta, is shown celebrating their successful raid. Asta is using binoculars, his face expressing excitement.  Other crew members, including a blonde male and a female with long hair,  are cheering.  Speech bubbles indicate their joy and plans to plunder. A second panel shows Asta's close-up, shouting angrily with a speech bubble that translates to something like "Bad things are not happening".  Two smaller figures, possibly children, are in a smaller panel at the bottom. The overall scene is one of chaotic jubilation and impending mischief.
