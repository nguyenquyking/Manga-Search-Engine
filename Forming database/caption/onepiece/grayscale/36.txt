Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  The panel depicts a dynamic battle scene.  Luffy, using his Gum-Gum abilities, is shown in multiple panels engaging in a fierce fight with Kaido.  Kaido, in his dragon form, is shown unleashing powerful attacks ("SHK," "BOOM!!", "DOOM!!"). Luffy is visibly impacted by Kaido's attacks, shown being thrown and knocked back ("HURBP!!!").  A speech bubble emphasizes that abilities alone cannot conquer the world.  The overall scene is intense, with motion lines and onomatopoeia enhancing the action.
