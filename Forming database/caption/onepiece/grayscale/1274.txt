One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes and characters.  The first scene shows a conversation between three characters:  a large, imposing figure (possibly Kaido's subordinate), a blonde woman (likely Yamato), and a masked individual (likely Kanjuro). They discuss Kanjuro's return and the sinking of the Akazaaya Samurai battleships. The second scene shows a discussion about Oden's lack of communication regarding Laugh Tale. The third scene shows a dramatic confrontation; a character confronts Lord Orochi's forces, and a surprised woman reacts.  The overall tone is one of intrigue and impending conflict.
