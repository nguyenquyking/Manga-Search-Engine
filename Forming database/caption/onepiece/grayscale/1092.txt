The next panel shows a man reacting with distress to a harsh reality. The bottom panel shows a character with a large hat, seemingly pleased to have found a good place to set sail, near a wrecked ship.  Another character in a hat is seen near the wreckage. A third character, light-haired, observes them.  The visual style is characteristic of One Piece manga, with distinct character designs and dynamic action lines.
