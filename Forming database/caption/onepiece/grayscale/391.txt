One Piece manga scene depicting a transformed character, possibly a Zoan type Devil Fruit user, resembling a dinosaur, interacting with Sanji.  Sanji is running away from the creature, who is asking "Where you been?".  Another panel shows Sanji encountering a geisha who was knocked through the air.  The geisha pleads with Sanji to let her go, stating she's merely an entertainer. Sanji is shown to be concerned and apologetic for the geisha's condition.  The transformed character is questioning if its transformation is over.  The overall scene takes place in a building with a traditional Japanese architectural style.
