One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two samurai.  One, with long dark hair in a topknot,  states he's missed chances for a glorious death.  The other, shorter with spiky hair, asks if this is where he makes his last stand.  A third samurai, possibly deceased, lies on the ground in the background.  The scene shows a tense standoff, possibly the culmination of a battle, with a significant power dynamic implied.  The dialogue suggests a choice between death and joining forces to conquer the world.
