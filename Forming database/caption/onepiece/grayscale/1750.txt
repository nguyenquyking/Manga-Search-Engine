One Piece manga panel depicting a narrative about Kozuki Oden's swords.  The scene shows Hiyori, holding Oden's sword Enma, while another character, presumably a samurai, objects to her giving away the family heirloom.  The panel also depicts a flashback of Oden's execution and the subsequent distribution of his swords; one to Hiyori (Enma) and one to her brother (Ame-no-Habakiri). The background shows the ruined landscape of Ringo in Wano Country.  Seven days remain until the raid on Onigashima.
