One Piece manga panel depicting the backstory of Pops, who built a village.  The scene shows a small village, contrasted with text explaining that when countries collapse, they create orphans, and that Pops was one of them. Pops secretly helped the village financially, despite never having a family.  The panel also shows the village's location as a lawless island, too poor to pay tribute to the World Government.  The final frame shows a younger Pops leaving the village to become a pirate.
