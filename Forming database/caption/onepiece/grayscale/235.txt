One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Kaido, in his hybrid dragon form, is engaged in a powerful clash with a colossal, mechanical bull.  The bull is Punk Corna Dio, piloted by several individuals.  Kaido is unleashing a fiery attack, while Punk Corna Dio counters with magnetic fields.  Another panel shows a close-up of Luffy's determined face, seemingly defying the scale of the battle with the line "You're not reaching that roof!!"  The scene is chaotic and displays extreme power levels from both sides.  Kaido's exhausted state is also highlighted.
