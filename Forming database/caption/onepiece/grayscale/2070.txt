One Piece manga panel depicting a map of Wano Country with characters discussing travel plans.  The map shows six regions: Kuri, Kibi, Flower Capital, Ringo, Hakumai, and Udon, separated by rivers.  A character points to Udon on the map, indicating their destination. Another character notes the journey's length.  A third character, seemingly a large, jovial man, is shown riding a crocodile, illustrating the difficult terrain.  The dialogue emphasizes the distance and the need to cross a river to reach Udon.
