One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  In the first, a worried character, possibly a captain, observes a situation involving Bepo and an unnamed idiot. He notes nails made of Sea Prism Stone.  The second shows a character, possibly a higher-ranking officer, confirming a capture and stating their intent to track down an escapee. A third panel shows a town, possibly Bakura Town, with multiple characters, including one who appears to be leaving. The final panel shows a small character, possibly Goroboe, being encouraged, while another character expresses regret, likely to Luffy. The overall setting suggests a post-battle or chase situation.
