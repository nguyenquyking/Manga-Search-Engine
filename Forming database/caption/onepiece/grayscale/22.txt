One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene in Wano Country.  Kaido, a large, horned figure, confronts Daimyo (feudal lords), asking them to join his cause or face war.  The Daimyo shown include Kibi, Haku-mai, Ringo, and Udon.  They are seen reacting to Kaido's ultimatum.  Another panel shows a battle scene with samurai fighting against a backdrop of a large dragon, possibly representing an alliance intent on avenging Oden's death and declaring Kozuki as the only Shogun.  The overall mood is tense and action-packed.
