One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene. Komurasaki's executioner, a large figure in ornate clothing, gloats over his actions, stating that two generations of her family have earned his wrath.  Simultaneously, Otoko, visibly distressed, cries out for her father, who is being executed. Another character laughs maniacally as the executions continue.  The scene is violent, showcasing multiple gunshots (“BLAM!”) and a distressed daughter witnessing the event. The visual style is characteristic of One Piece's dynamic action sequences.
