One Piece manga panel depicting a festive scene in the Flower Capital of Wano.  The top panel shows a wide establishing shot of the city with numerous people and lanterns.  Otama is shown in the lower panels, seemingly enjoying the festival, while interacting with a masked figure (possibly a member of the Tobiroppo or another significant character). Another character, possibly a female, is also seen enjoying the festivities. The text indicates Otama is asking for forgiveness from her master. The overall atmosphere is joyful and celebratory, typical of a Japanese festival.
