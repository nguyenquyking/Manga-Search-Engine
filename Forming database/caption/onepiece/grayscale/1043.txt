Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A dramatic depiction of a fierce battle.  A large, serpentine creature, possibly a mythical dragon, is shown in the background, creating a massive storm or wave. In the foreground, several characters are engaged in combat. One character, possibly a pirate, is shown falling or being thrown into the water. Another character, seemingly being attacked, is shown in distress.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines, sound effects ("GLONK!", "THUMP!!", "RAAAAH"), and intense expressions, suggesting a significant moment of conflict within a larger battle.  The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga.
