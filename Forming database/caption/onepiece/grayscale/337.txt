One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of destruction in a Japanese-style building.  Sanji, visibly strained, is shown in one panel, having apparently used a high-speed movement technique to become temporarily invisible.  Another panel shows Chuji, relieved, and a small animal, possibly a mouse, nearby.  The overall scene indicates a recent battle with significant damage to the building's structure.  Text bubbles show dialogue expressing surprise and concern over Sanji's actions and stamina.
