This One Piece crossover manga panel depicts a group of My Hero Academia characters dressed as pirates.  Midoriya Izuku, as the captain, leads the "A-Class Pirate Crew," including Bakugo Katsuki, Uraraka Ochaco, and others.  They are shown in various poses of excitement and determination.  In a separate panel, a villainous-looking character, possibly a parody of a One Piece antagonist, gives a thumbs-up, seemingly approving of their actions.  The text indicates celebration of a 1000-episode milestone and highlights the crew's mission as "doing good deeds for others."
