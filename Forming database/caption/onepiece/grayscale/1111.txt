Close-up of  a grim-faced character, possibly Zoro, partially obscured by a large, weathered weapon, possibly a katana.  He wears a distinctive hat with circular embellishments. The lower panel depicts a stormy landscape with a figure (possibly another character) standing near a large cross or monument, accompanied by onomatopoeia suggesting wind or movement, and a monstrous eye looming in the background. The scene evokes a sense of impending battle or confrontation.
