A chaotic scene unfolds at a food stall in a One Piece manga panel.  Two brothers are arguing, with the younger brother expressing alarm ("Uh-oh! Big bro, this turned ugly fast!").  A crowd of people surrounds the stall, vying for food ("One bowl, please!"). One person asserts their place in line ("Hey, I was first!").  A stern-faced man observes the scene, commenting on the potential dishonesty of the vendor ("And if they're the kind of scum who cheats their customers too?"). Another character, possibly a vendor, confidently states their belief in winning a competition based on ingredient quality ("I gotta say, if my opponent's leaning on ingredient quality only...then I don't see myself losing.").  The overall visual style is dynamic and emphasizes the tension and competition.
