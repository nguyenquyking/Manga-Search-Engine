One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A massive, serpentine dragon-like creature, possibly Yamato's mythical Zoan form, dominates the scene, its roar ("GRRR," "RAAAAA") echoing.  A large, powerful figure wielding a spiked club confronts the creature.  The smaller figures surrounding him appear to be engaged in the chaotic fight.  The final panel shows fast-moving objects ("SWISH SWISH") suggesting rapid attacks or movements.  The overall visual style is dynamic and emphasizes the scale and intensity of the combat.
