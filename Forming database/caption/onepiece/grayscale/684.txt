One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Luffy, infused with the color of the Supreme King, is shown struggling after a failed attempt. His technique is described as "crude and clumsy."  The character is falling, surrounded by debris and swirling effects.  Another panel shows him from a different perspective, still falling, with text bubbles indicating his surprise ("Gum-Gum... What was it again?") and the impact of his attack ("Woro Ro Ro Ro!"). The background is a rocky, desolate landscape. The overall scene conveys the character's struggle and the aftermath of a powerful but poorly executed attack.
