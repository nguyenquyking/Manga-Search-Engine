One Piece manga scene depicting a fierce battle.  Zoro, using his "Paradise Totsuka" attack, clashes with a monstrous dragon-like creature.  Another samurai, possibly a subordinate, is seen fighting a separate part of the beast.  In another panel, a scowling Kaido observes the battle, commenting on Zoro's technique.  The scene is dynamic, showing energy blasts and sword strikes.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
