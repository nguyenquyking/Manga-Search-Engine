One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation and alliance.  A large, grinning man, possibly Worororonoa Zoro, declares Alber his right-hand man, stating he's the only one who can change the world. Alber, a scarred Lunarian, is shown previously enduring strenuous tests, escaping confinement.  Another character, possibly a government official, observes Alber's escape.  The scene transitions to Alber's new role as "King" under the large man's wing, with escaping subjects and a fiery background suggesting a chaotic situation.
