One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  Luffy, enraged, confronts a large, mechanized opponent labeled "Punk Rotten!!!"  Another character, Bounce Man, is shown being attacked by a giant, dark hand.  Meanwhile, a third character, seemingly Roronoa Zoro, uses his sword against the same giant hand, utilizing his "Room" ability.  The scene is filled with action lines and onomatopoeia indicating impacts and movements. The overall mood is one of intense combat.
