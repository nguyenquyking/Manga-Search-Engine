Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist of One Piece, is depicted in a monochrome manga panel. He is wearing his signature straw hat, a large captain's coat adorned with buttons, and is smiling broadly.  He holds a large piece of meat in his hand. The panel is a volume cover for Volume 95, titled "Oden's Adventure."  A small, bird-like creature with a pirate hat is visible in the upper right corner. The One Piece logo is prominent, and the artist's name, Eiichiro Oda, is displayed at the bottom.
