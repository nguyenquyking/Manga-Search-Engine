One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion about a peaceful village hidden behind a waterfall.  Two characters, whose names are not explicitly shown, comment on the boss's intimidating appearance. A subsequent panel reveals a serene village scene, contrasted with a dark cave entrance.  A large, furry character, possibly a mink, smokes a pipe, seemingly amused by the contrast.  The final panel shows a hand emerging from the ground, suggesting a possible threat or surprise.
