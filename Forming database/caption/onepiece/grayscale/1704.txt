One Piece manga panel depicting Monkey D. Luffy and Usopp excitedly running,  Luffy's name and number 56 visible on his shirt.  Usopp is shown with his signature long nose and is partially obscured by Luffy.  Text bubbles indicate it's lunchtime, and Luffy's joyful exclamation "F0000 00000 000-D!!".  A smaller panel shows Luffy, Usopp, and a third character (likely another Straw Hat) running, with speech bubbles showing excited chatter and "Straw Hat!! You're going down today!!". Another smaller panel shows a scene of other children observing.  The overall mood is energetic and playful.
