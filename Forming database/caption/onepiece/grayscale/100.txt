Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A dramatic scene unfolds on Onigashima.  A powerful, horned figure (likely an Onigashima inhabitant or a transformed character) is shown braced against an attack as a smaller figure, possibly a Devil Fruit user wielding a lightning-based attack, descends from above.  The larger figure is reacting to the impending fall of Onigashima, indicated by the text "IS GOING TO FALL!!!"  The panel ends with a "To be continued!" indicating a cliffhanger.  The smaller figure's attack is depicted with lightning and sound effects.  The lower panel shows close-ups of two faces, likely characters observing the event.
