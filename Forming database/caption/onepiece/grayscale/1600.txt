One Piece manga panel depicting Kawamatsu, a kappa, recounting his past.  He describes a shipwreck that separated him from his mother.  Villagers attacked them, calling them "fish-men," injuring his mother, and preventing their return home.  The narrative includes a flashback showing the boat sinking and the subsequent attack.  Kawamatsu states he now lives on scraps due to being ostracized.  The panel also shows Cat Viper (in a smaller panel) and a discussion about hot food.
