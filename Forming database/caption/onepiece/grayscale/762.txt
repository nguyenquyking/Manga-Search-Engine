One Piece manga scene depicting a battle on the Skull Dome rooftop.  Kaido and others are present.  A large skull-shaped structure is visible.  Trafalgar Law is asked to use his powers to move one of the giant opponents.  One character, seemingly an enemy, laughs maniacally and prepares to disassemble something. Another character, possibly Luffy, is shown reacting with surprise, anticipating a major event.  The scene is intense and action-oriented.
