A smaller, dark-haired character is shown mid-air using a staff-like weapon.  Another character, possibly a member of the Tobiroppo, is shown reacting to the attack.  The lower panel showcases a character (likely a Tobiroppo member) executing a powerful attack called "Nari-Kabura Arrow,"  with intense motion lines indicating speed and force. The scene is filled with impact effects and onomatopoeia, emphasizing the intensity of the combat.
