One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Zoro, panting, observes a large group of Gifters,  numbering nearly 500, who are loyal to Kaido.  A female Gifter speaks, urging others to follow Kaido's path.  Another panel shows a woman, possibly Ulti, encouraging surrender.  The scene is tense, showcasing the overwhelming numbers of Kaido's forces.  The visual style is characteristic of the One Piece manga, with dramatic action lines and speech bubbles.
