One Piece manga panel depicting the aftermath of a battle in Wano Country.  The scene shows a graveyard marked by numerous simple wooden posts under a blossoming cherry tree.  Several figures, including Kin'emon and possibly other samurai, stand somberly before the graves.  Text indicates they are waiting for the return of Momonosuke and others, expressing doubt and weariness after ten years of waiting.  Other panels show close-ups of worried faces, highlighting the emotional toll of the long wait and the difficulty of believing in a promised return.  A map of Wano's regions (Kuri, Udon, Ringo, Hakumai, and Oni) is also shown.  The overall mood is one of despair, grief, and uncertainty.
