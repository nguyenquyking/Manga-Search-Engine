One Piece manga panel depicting Yamato, visibly distressed and expressing self-doubt ("I am hurting... I feel disgusted with myself... I'm so stupid... and frivolous...").  Yamato is shown interacting with Momonosuke, who is praised for bravery. A large eel-like creature suddenly appears, causing Yamato to exclaim in surprise ("Whaaat?! An eel?!").  The scene takes place within the Onigashima castle, with a map indicating the "Right-Brain Tower" location. Yamato's inner turmoil is emphasized, contrasting with others' high opinion of her ("Everyone thinks too highly of me").  The panel also reveals a section of the castle's structure.
