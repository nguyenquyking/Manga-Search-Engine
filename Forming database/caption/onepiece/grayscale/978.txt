One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Sanji, in a suit, prepares an attack with a fiery burst, saying "Let's go!!". Another character, possibly a subordinate, asks "You ready?".  The next panel shows numerous figures falling from the sky after being seemingly attacked by Sanji's powerful move. One shouts "AAAAAH!!". In the final panel, Sanji, observing the scene from a distance, remarks "Nice view." while another character notices a Straw Hat member being carried away, exclaiming "Hey!! He's carrying one of Straw Hat's guys!!".  There is a verbal exchange between two characters, one pleading "Please, Pops!!" and the other responding "No, you idiot!!".  The overall scene is dynamic and action-packed, emphasizing the power of Sanji's attack and the perilous situation of the Straw Hat crew member.
