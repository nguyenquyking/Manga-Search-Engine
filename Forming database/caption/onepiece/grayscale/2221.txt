One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce clash between two characters.  In the central panel,  Kuzan (Aokiji) in his frozen form, wielding a sword, engages in a powerful attack against a fur-clad opponent, possibly Marco, who is also armed with a sword.  The impact is emphasized by strong action lines and onomatopoeia.  Smaller panels show onlookers reacting;  Luffy and his crew are present, observing the battle with expressions of shock and concern.  A woman, possibly Hiyori, is also shown in a separate panel, seemingly witnessing the clash. The overall scene is dynamic and highlights the intensity of the sword fight.
