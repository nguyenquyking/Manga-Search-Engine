One Piece manga scene depicting a chaotic chase.  Luffy and his crew, aboard a large ornate food-laden ship (possibly a festival float), are pursued by Trafalgar Law ("Traffy") and his crew. Law yells "After them! Food thieves!!" while Luffy's crew shouts "We're in a hurry!!" and "Excuse us, coming through!!"  Other characters are shown being knocked aside in the commotion. The scene is dynamic with motion lines and sound effects indicating speed and impact.  A large lion-dog-like figurehead adorns the front of Luffy's ship.
