Kaido, a massive figure with large horns and a muscular build, unleashes a powerful attack, "Thunder Bagua," shown by a large impact effect and the text indicating the attack's name.  A smaller figure lies defeated on the ground, seemingly injured.  In the panels above, a smaller character is seen flying and then falling into the water. Kaido appears surprised by this event, questioning "What King was that...?" This suggests a powerful opponent was defeated before the main action of the scene. The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and impact effects, typical of One Piece's battle sequences.
