One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic underwater scene.  A giant Sea Monk's hand emerges from the water, causing a large splash.  Several characters, seemingly Straw Hats, are submerged and struggling. One character, possibly Chopper, is shown being held by a large hand.  Another character yells "Hurry! There's no time!!" while others express shock and alarm ("What?! What?!").  The overall scene is one of urgent escape from an underwater threat.
