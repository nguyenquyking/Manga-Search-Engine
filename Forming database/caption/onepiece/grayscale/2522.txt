One Piece SBS Question Corner features several panels.  The first shows Nami holding a diagram seemingly related to Perospero's candy. The next panel shows a question about whether Perospero licked Nami after covering her in syrup. The following panels depict Perospero, appearing to be commenting on Nami's appearance.  Another section features a question about fugu (pufferfish) and Reiju. A final section displays a question about Shakky and her possible connection to "Rox," 40 years prior.  The overall theme involves reader questions and Oda's humorous responses.
