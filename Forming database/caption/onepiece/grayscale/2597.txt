One Piece manga panel depicting a farewell scene.  Sanji, in a hooded cloak, smokes a cigarette and watches a tearful, three-eyed woman, likely Boa Hancock, as she embraces someone off-panel.  The scene is presented as a series of filmstrip-like panels showing Sanji departing.  Hancock expresses gratitude and sorrow, marked by the text "Thank you... and goodbye...".  The final panel shows Sanji walking away, leaving a trail of smoke.  Visual elements include filmstrip borders and smoke effects.
