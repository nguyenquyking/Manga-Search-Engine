One Piece manga scene depicting Shinobu, with horns and in a kimono, holding a small, round object, reacting to Luffy's current state.  She declares a one-on-one confrontation and expresses urgency.  Another character, seemingly Momonosuke, is shown injured and listening. Shinobu's statement about Luffy being in her hands is highlighted.  The setting appears to be a traditional Japanese-style building.  A third panel shows a character, possibly Oden, reading a book, seemingly reflecting on past adventures.  The overall mood is tense and urgent.
