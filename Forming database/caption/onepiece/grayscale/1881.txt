One Piece manga scene: Luffy, disguised as a samurai, and another character are pursued by Big Mom. Big Mom is shown in a large panel, causing destruction as she moves. Luffy expresses concern about the collars around their necks, which contain blades that would sever their heads if they fall.  Luffy's disguise is apparently not working, as Big Mom questions his identity and the consumption of her Oshiruko. The scene is dynamic, showing chaos and peril.
