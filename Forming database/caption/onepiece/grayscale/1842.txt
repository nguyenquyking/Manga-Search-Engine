One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring Oda's responses to fan questions.  The first question concerns the similarity between a skirt worn by a character and Moda's skirt.  The second question asks about the criteria for reader-submitted chapter cover requests, noting a shift from the previous "animal and Straw Hat" requirement.  Oda explains that while there's no official set of rules, he chooses requests that capture his interest through creative animal and character choices.  Images of King Seki and Princess Comane, and several Straw Hat characters (including Usopp) are shown alongside text.
