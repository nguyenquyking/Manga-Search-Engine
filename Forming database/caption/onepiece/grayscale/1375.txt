One Piece manga panel depicting emotional reactions to a tragic event.  Kanjuro, distraught, cries out "Stop this, Kanjuro!!" while witnessing the deaths of Oden's loyal retainers.  Toki and another woman are shown reacting to the deaths.  A narration box describes how Oden's death was delayed for 20 years.  Another character, possibly a samurai, argues that they know the truth about Oden's character better than anyone, contrasting the sorrow with a defiant spirit. A bird flies overhead, symbolizing perhaps the loss and the passing of time. The scene is set against a backdrop of stormy waters and sinking ships.
