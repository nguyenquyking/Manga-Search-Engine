One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A shadowy figure, possibly Luffy in Gear 5,  is the central focus, performing a powerful attack represented by swirling teal energy shaped like a musical note.  The attack engulfs several members of the  "Orchestra," including a bloodied, screaming woman (possibly a member of the crew) and other vividly colored figures. The shadowy figure's action is accompanied by the onomatopoeia "GYAAA AAAAH!!" indicating pain or shock from the recipients of the attack. The word "ORCHESTRA!!" is prominently displayed, suggesting the name of the group being attacked.  The overall style is dynamic and action-packed, characteristic of One Piece's art style.
