One Piece manga scene: Sanji, trapped in a large spiderweb, attempts to rescue a woman in a spotted kimono from another character.  A large shadowy figure observes from above, shouting "Don't you dare!"  Sanji is agilely maneuvering within the web, while the woman appears distressed.  The scene is dynamic, showing both struggle and playful elements ("Naughty!" speech bubbles).  The overall setting suggests a confrontation within a building.
