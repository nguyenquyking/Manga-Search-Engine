One Piece manga panel depicting a battle. A slime-like creature, possibly a transformed character, exclaims about its body being altered.  Another character, a woman in a revealing outfit, comments on the creature's appearance and initiates an attack labeled "Tempest Kick."  The slime creature is then shown reacting to the attack ("Nooo!!"). The woman states that playtime is over, and a "Cool Charge" attack is implied. The visual elements include speech bubbles, action lines, and onomatopoeia indicating impact and movement.
