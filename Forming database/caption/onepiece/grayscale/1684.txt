A panel from the One Piece manga depicts a conversation about the Seven Warlords' disbandment.  Issho (the character with a Marine hat and cigar) and another Marine officer (bandaged head) are shown.  The background prominently features the New Marineford headquarters. Issho expresses skepticism about the decision's consequences for world power balance, while the other officer expresses trust in the SSG (likely the SWORD organization). The dialogue boxes reveal internal conflict and debate regarding the necessary sacrifices made to maintain order.
