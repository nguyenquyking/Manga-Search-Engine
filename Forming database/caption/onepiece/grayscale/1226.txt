Other characters are shown reacting to the events, including individuals discussing a past encounter ("I saw 'em at the boiling 20 years ago!") and a character who subdued Lord Momonosuke ("I punished him...but only enough to knock him unconscious!!!").  The scene is set outdoors in snowy conditions, emphasizing the tense atmosphere.  Izo's return is also noted.  The overall visual style is consistent with One Piece manga, featuring dynamic action lines and expressive character designs.
