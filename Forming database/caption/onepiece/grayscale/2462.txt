One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Luffy, visibly distressed, is accused by a winged, masked figure (likely a high-ranking samurai) of eating food intended for Otama, a young girl who is shown separately, clutching her stomach. The samurai is enraged, wielding a large sword and using a long nose as a weapon. Luffy pleads for mercy, explaining he saved Otama's life.  The scene highlights the contrast between Luffy's remorse and the samurai's anger, with text boxes detailing Otama's poverty and the significance of the food.
