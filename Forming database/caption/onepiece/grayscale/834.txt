One Piece manga panel depicting Black Maria, a Tobiroppo, on the third floor of Onigashima.  She's in her monstrous form, towering over several Akazaya Nine samurai who are either mortally wounded or defeated.  Jack, another member of the Tobiroppo, observes the scene, taking the situation as an insult.  The panel showcases the power disparity between the Tobiroppo and the Akazaya, with Black Maria's size and the Akazaya's defeated state highlighting this.  The scene is chaotic, with several speech bubbles indicating screams and the sounds of wheezing.
