One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic fight scene.  A large, heavily armored character with a star insignia (possibly a General) is being violently thrown by a cloaked figure.  The impact is shown in several panels, with the armored figure crashing down and creating a large explosion.  The cloaked figure is performing a "Suplex" move.  The armored character's expressions show surprise and pain.  The panels showcase the force of the attack, with speed lines and impact sounds ("Ba-Boom!", "Take This!", "Suplex!!!").
