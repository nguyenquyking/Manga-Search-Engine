One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation.  A masked individual, seemingly "Soba Mask," is being pressured to reveal their real name by onlookers.  The scene shows multiple characters: Soba Mask (central focus), two individuals in the top left panel appearing to be onlookers, and a lizard-like character in the bottom right, possibly an ally to Soba Mask. The speech bubbles indicate debate about Soba Mask's chosen name and anticipation of a scientific demonstration.  The visual style is consistent with One Piece's dynamic action and expressive character designs.
