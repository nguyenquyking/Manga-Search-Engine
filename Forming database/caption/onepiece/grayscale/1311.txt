One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene. A large structure, possibly a feast area, is collapsing.  Characters react with alarm: one, with spiky hair, exclaims about the tipping structure, while another, possibly Zoro, observes the commotion from a distance.  A third character, seemingly with devil horns, walks towards the scene.  The overall tone is one of sudden disaster and impending action.
