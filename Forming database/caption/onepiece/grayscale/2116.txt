One Piece manga scene: A female character, possibly a child, is attacked by a male character wielding a sword. The attacker, in ornate clothing, shouts, "You dare to laugh at me, child?!" The female character pleads, "Eek! Please, no!!"  Another character observes, commenting on the attacker's laughing tic and urging someone to help the girl.  The scene depicts a violent action, with onomatopoeia illustrating the sword strike and impact. The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga.
