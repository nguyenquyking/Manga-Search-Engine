One Piece manga panel depicting a colossal, monstrous bird-like creature, possibly a mythical beast.  The creature is predominantly black and white, highly detailed with sharp, jagged features, and its mouth is open in a roar. A smaller figure, possibly a human character (unidentifiable), stands in the foreground, appearing dwarfed by the creature's size.  The speech bubbles indicate the smaller figure's reaction: "No Way." and the creature's roar: "ROOOAR." The scene suggests a confrontation or imminent attack. The background is rocky and desolate.  The overall mood is one of awe and impending danger.
