One Piece manga panel depicting several characters, primarily two mink,  burying swords in the snow. One mink asks if the other understands their actions.  Another mink comments on the cold weather and plans to sell stolen food.  The scene shows a snowy, partially destroyed building in the background, suggesting a post-battle or ravaged environment.  The overall mood is a mix of conspiratorial action and opportunistic scavenging.  The text includes expressions like "Hide the swords," "ransacking graves,"  and "freezing today."
