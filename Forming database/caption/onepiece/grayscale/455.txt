One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large, dragon-like creature attacks, with speech bubbles indicating its roar and question, "Where do you think you're going?!" Kin'emon and possibly Kikunojo are urging Momonosuke and Shusuke to flee.  Kin'emon requests strength, promising to do his part.  The scene shows intense action and peril, with the dragon's attack emphasized by motion lines and impact sounds.  The overall tone is urgent and chaotic.
