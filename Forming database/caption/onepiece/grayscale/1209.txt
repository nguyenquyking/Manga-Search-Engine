A manga panel depicting a tense interrogation. A large, angry man, possibly a powerful figure judging by his attire and demeanor, demands the name of a smaller, bound individual.  The smaller individual is being threatened with execution, which is framed as an attempt to end "the old Wano."  The large man expresses doubt that the smaller individual is the son of Kozuki Oden and Toki.  The scene is set against the backdrop of a structure, possibly a castle, suggesting a significant event.  Visual cues, such as the bound individual's position and the large man's expression, highlight the power imbalance and the impending threat.
