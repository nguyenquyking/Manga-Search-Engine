One Piece SBS Question Corner:  A reader asks if the shared name "Otsuru" between Kin'emon's wife and a Navy Vice Admiral is a coincidence. The response explains the similarity to the main characters in the manga *Nana*, both named Nana, highlighting the non-coincidental nature of similar names in fiction.  The second question asks for illustrations of Usopp at ages 40 and 60.  The response shows Usopp at age 40, stating "Luffy's my underling," and at age 60, where he comments "The pirate flag...I'd love to see again!!!"  Another image of Usopp at 60 shows him with Zoro, stating "Zolo? Oh yeah...".  The images depict Otsuru, Vice Admiral Tsuru, and two versions of Usopp at different ages.
