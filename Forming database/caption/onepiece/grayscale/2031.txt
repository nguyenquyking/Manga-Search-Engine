One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character resembling Zoro (with a similar hairstyle and fighting stance) uses a sword to attack a larger, cloaked figure. The attack is depicted with impact words "SHUNK" and "UNK". A surprised female character witnesses the action, while another character (possibly a masked antagonist) is shown in a separate panel.  Speech bubbles indicate surprise ("Huh?", "Whoa!") and aggressive intent ("Have at thee!!"). Blood splatter suggests injury. The scene is dynamic and action-packed, focused on a sudden, powerful sword strike.
