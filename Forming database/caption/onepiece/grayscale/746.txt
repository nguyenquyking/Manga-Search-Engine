A One Piece manga panel depicts a dramatic battle scene.  Trafalgar Law uses his Anti-Bacterial Curtain ability to attack a large, reptilian creature, possibly a hybrid zoan type, causing significant damage. The creature reacts with pain ("Urgh!!!"), while Law's attack is depicted with impactful sound effects. The scene is filled with motion lines indicating the force of the attack and the creature's recoil.  The creature speaks, acknowledging Law's power.
