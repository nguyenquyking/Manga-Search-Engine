Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A dynamic battle scene unfolds, showcasing a powerful attack.  A large, swirling, water-like projectile, labeled "BOIYOING," slams into a rocky landscape, creating a massive explosion.  A character, possibly a fish-man, is shown launching a spear-like weapon just before the impact. Another character, seemingly the target, is seen reacting to the attack, with sound effects indicating impact and distress. The final panel shows a wide-eyed character, possibly the attacker, exclaiming "ZERO!!!" amidst the chaos.  The overall scene is filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia that emphasize the force and speed of the attack.
