One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy, a girl (possibly Tama), and a man (possibly a Wano resident) at a food stall. Luffy impatiently asks the girl how long she'll take to eat, while she enjoys a bowl of food, reacting with extreme delight.  The scene suggests it's the girl's birthday.  The visual style is characteristic of One Piece manga.
