One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A heavily injured character, possibly Luffy, is shown gasping for breath,  while another character collapses, exclaiming "I'm done."  The scene suggests the emergence of Kaido, as indicated by speech bubbles referencing him.  The final panel shows a powerful attack, possibly from Kaido, causing widespread destruction.  The overall tone is one of exhaustion and impending danger.
