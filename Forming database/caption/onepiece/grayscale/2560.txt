One Piece manga panel depicting a dynamic scene.  Morley, a steampunk-styled character with goggles and mechanical attachments, is mid-action, seemingly launching himself forward.  He's addressing a larger, shadowy figure who appears to be a powerful opponent, possibly the Captain.  Another character, possibly a subordinate or ally of Morley, is visible in a smaller panel, expressing concern. The scene also shows a distant view of four other individuals, described as being scattered across the world.  The overall tone is one of intense action and urgency.  The text indicates Morley possesses newly invented weapons.
