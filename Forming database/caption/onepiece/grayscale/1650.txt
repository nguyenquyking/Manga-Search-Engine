One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of chaos and fire.  Women react with shock ("Oh my... What a man!") to a speech ("Oden speeches"), while other characters observe a large fire ("It's not the fire... Hey! Is it a big fire?!").  A character in a dark robe is seemingly unconcerned, stating "What's going on here? No one's avoiding me like usual."  Another character approaches, intending to apprehend him but accepts a bribe.  The scene features traditional Japanese architecture, bells ringing, and the sound effects of clang, kaboom, and murmurs.
