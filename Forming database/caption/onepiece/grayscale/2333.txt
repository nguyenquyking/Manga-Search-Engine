One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene during a rebellion against Wano.  Luffy,  Straw Hat,  is seen alongside other characters amidst a fire and destruction.  He expresses his intention to repay a favor to Tama.  Other characters, including a samurai, are shown reacting to the unfolding events.  The panel also features a scene where a large animal, possibly a lion, is still conscious despite the chaos, and another character, possibly Master Holdem, is shown in distress.  The overall visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga's characteristic dynamic action and expressive character designs.
