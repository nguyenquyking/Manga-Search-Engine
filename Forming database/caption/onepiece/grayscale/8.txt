One Piece manga panel depicting Onigashima's fall.  The island is shown collapsing into the sea, with characters reacting to the event.  A large portion of Onigashima is shown breaking apart and falling into the ocean, creating large splashes.  A character, possibly Nami, expresses fear about going down with the island.  Another character, possibly Kaido, is shown in the lower panel, possibly questioning the Straw Hats' ability to create a new world.  The flame clouds surrounding Onigashima have disappeared.  The overall scene is chaotic and depicts a significant moment of peril.
