One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A female character with long hair uses a "Rain Tempo" attack, indicated by diagonal rain-like lines, against another character. A third character, wearing glasses, reacts with surprise, commenting on the rain and the attack's "cool ball" aspect.  The main action centers around a powerful attack ("Pour Down") directed at a smaller, seemingly defenseless character.  The panel includes onomatopoeia illustrating the sounds and force of the attacks.
