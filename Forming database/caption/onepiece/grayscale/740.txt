A One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A large, enraged character, seemingly a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user resembling a lion-dog, roars "Come on out, kid!!!" while flames erupt around it.  Smaller figures are seen on its back. In a separate panel, a shocked group reacts with fear and surprise, with speech bubbles exclaiming "Big Mom?!" and "Whaaat?!".  The larger character's dialogue also includes threats to rip off a nose.  The overall scene is chaotic and intense, suggesting an imminent attack or battle.
