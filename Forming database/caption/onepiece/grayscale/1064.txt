One Piece manga scene depicting multiple characters in a battle.  A large, obese man in traditional Japanese garb, likely a villain, activates a plague attack, transforming individuals into Oni (demon-like creatures).  Luffy, recognizable by his straw hat and fighting stance, is shown being kicked by another character, possibly Nami.  The scene takes place in a multi-level tower, with text indicating the closure of doors to contain the plague's spread.  The text also mentions "Ice Oni" and "Shining Jewel," suggesting elements of the attack.
