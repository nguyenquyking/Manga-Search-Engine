One Piece manga panel depicting intense combat.  A large, monstrous creature (possibly a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user) is engaged in fierce battle with multiple opponents.  One opponent, possibly Luffy using Gear 5, is shown being impacted by a powerful attack, indicated by impact sounds and motion lines.  Another opponent is seen launching a counter-attack, labeled "Gum-Gum...".  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia suggesting powerful blows and impacts. The top panel shows a large skull-like structure, possibly a part of the environment or a related power.  The overall tone suggests a climactic moment of a powerful fight.
