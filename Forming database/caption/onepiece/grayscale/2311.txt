One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with Napping Kyoshiro, a Kurozumi clan money changer, and a flashback to Oden's wife. Kyoshiro, in elaborate patterned robes, sits calmly, while text boxes reveal Oden's wife's dying words about casting shadows on the night and the brilliance of the dawn.  The background shows a burning castle, referencing a past event.  Kyoshiro's relaxed demeanor contrasts with the dramatic context of the flashback and the implication that he is playing a significant role in unfolding events.  The panel also shows Shogun Orochi being called a coward, further contextualizing the scene's tension.
