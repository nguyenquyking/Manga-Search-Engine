One Piece manga panel depicting a scene split into three parts.  The first shows a close-up of a character's emotional face, possibly Oden, crying tears of joy, while speech bubbles reveal a plan to defeat Orochi and Kaido and fulfill Oden's wish. The second panel shows a scene with a THUD sound effect and Momonosuke leaving. The third panel depicts Lady Hiyori and other characters, seemingly confused and disoriented, amidst rubble, questioning their location and if they are dreaming.  Birds are chirping in the background of the third panel.
