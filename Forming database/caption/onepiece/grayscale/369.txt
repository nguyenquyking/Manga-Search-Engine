One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Luffy, observes as a monstrous, dark-colored creature with a spiked, bird-like head and  armored plating is forcefully pulled backward by an unseen force. The creature's expression is one of pain and strain.  The creature is labeled "Imperial."  The action involves the pulling of the creature's back crest, a key element in the attack.  Luffy, seemingly surprised, comments on the unexpected technique.  The overall tone is action-packed and intense.
