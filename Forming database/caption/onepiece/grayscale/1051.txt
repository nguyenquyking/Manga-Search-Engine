One Piece manga scene depicting a crisis.  Characters react to a rapidly spreading infection turning victims into ice zombies.  Yamato expresses concern, while another character (possibly Queen) gleefully observes the chaos, noting the infected will die within an hour.  The scene shows the zombies' increasing ferocity and muscle mass, while their skin freezes.  A large, round character (possibly Queen) laughs maniacally, seeming to enjoy the situation.  The overall tone is one of urgency and impending doom.
