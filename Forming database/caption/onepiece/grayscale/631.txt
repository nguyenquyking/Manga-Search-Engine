One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A large, pink-haired, fanged character (likely a mink) is engaging in combat.  He uses a "Finger Pistol" attack, striking a smaller, dark-purple-clad opponent.  Another character, a large blue-skinned individual, observes, expressing anger and clenching his fists. The pink-haired character is accused of leading the "Sun Pirates" and is shown using a powerful attack causing "Spots."  The scene is intense, with onomatopoeia highlighting the attacks and expressions of anger.
