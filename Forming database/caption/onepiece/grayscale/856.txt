One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Luffy, using Gear 5, attacks a complex mechanical device, yelling "You got it!!".  Killer urges Luffy to keep the pressure on Kaido.  Another panel shows a character, possibly Kaido, reacting with "Hmm?".  A large mechanical device is being destroyed, with explosions and damage shown.  The Straw Hats are actively engaged in attacking the machine and Kaido's forces.  The scene is chaotic and dynamic, with multiple attacks and counter-attacks in progress.  The overall visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga.
