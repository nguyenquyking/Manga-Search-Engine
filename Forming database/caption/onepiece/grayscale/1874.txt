One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy's worried expression as he asks if someone is alive.  The next panel shows Master Queen, seemingly defeated, surrounded by other characters amidst rubble and smoke.  Text indicates she knocked out a 1.3 billion berry bounty character in two hits, prompting a report to Kaido. The scene is chaotic with onomatopoeia emphasizing the impact and surrounding murmurs.  Specific character interactions are not clearly defined beyond the central focus on Master Queen's defeat and Luffy's concern.
