One Piece SBS Question Corner features several panels.  The top panel shows a caricatured individual pointing at a stylized "SS" logo, indicating a correction.  Below, a question from "Yuchabin" asks Oda about a Spinosaurus depiction, noting a tail correction in chapter 983.  Oda's response explains the updated paleontological findings influencing the drawing.  A subsequent question from "Sanadacchi" expresses concern about content restrictions and makes a suggestive comment about a character's outfit.  Oda's response is a stern rebuke to "Sanadacchi," invoking security.  The final panel shows Nami in two different outfits, one a kimono and the other a towel, likely referencing Sanadacchi's comment. Momo Daifuku also announces their intention to join the Straw Hat Crew.
