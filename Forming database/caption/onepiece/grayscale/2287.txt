One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle. Shutenmaru, a large, horned figure, is engaged in combat, wielding a weapon and shouting "Get away, people! Shutenmaru and Jack...".  He attacks several figures including what appears to be  Jaack, who is shown reacting with surprise and concern.  The scene is chaotic, with onomatopoeia indicating intense clashing sounds.  Okobore town is under attack ("They'll raze Okobore town to the ground!!").  Other characters are present but not clearly identifiable. The overall mood is intense and violent.
