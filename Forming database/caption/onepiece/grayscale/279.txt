One Piece manga panel depicting a cooking scene.  A character with long, light-colored hair and a topknot, possibly Sanji, performs "Mizu Mawashi," a traditional method of mixing buckwheat flour and water.  Another character, whose face is partially visible and appears startled, observes the process.  The text explains Mizu Mawashi and its effect on the dough. A third character, possibly a chef, is shown preparing ingredients at a table.  The scene is dynamic, with motion lines indicating the swirling of the flour and water.
