One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows an elderly man, possibly a samurai, sitting calmly. The second depicts a hilly landscape. The third panel shows a young girl, possibly Hiyori, crying, while another girl performs a kappa dance.  A large, possibly monstrous, figure asks if two people are still alive. The final panel shows a character reacting with distress and a building, possibly a castle, in the distance.  The overall theme suggests a search for proof of death and a reaction to the unexpected survival of individuals.
