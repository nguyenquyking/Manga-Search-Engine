One Piece manga scene depicting:  A tense situation where several characters, including  a smoking Straw Hat member (likely Zoro or Law, but requires further context for definitive identification),  are searching for a sealed storeroom within a Skull Dome.  The scene shows multiple panels illustrating the characters' confusion about directions, with one character (likely a member of Kin'emon's group) asking for guidance.  Another panel shows a character running, possibly pursued or attempting to escape.  The final panel depicts a large, rocky mass submerged in water, possibly indicating a significant event or obstacle. The dialogue boxes emphasize the urgency and difficulty of navigating the Skull Dome.
