Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga image:  A chaotic battle scene unfolds. Ulti, a Tobiroppo member with horns and long hair, is shown being attacked by a character (possibly a member of the Straw Hats) who has dark, curly hair.  Ulti is visibly injured, and the attacker's impact is emphasized by sound effects. Other panels depict an earlier attack using bamboo javelins, and reactions from other characters, showcasing multiple points of conflict. The overall scene is one of intense combat, with a focus on Ulti's defeat.
