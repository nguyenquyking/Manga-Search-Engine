One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between Momonosuke, Zoro, and a female character (possibly Hiyori).  Momonosuke is using a battle cry ("Sunacchi") learned from Zoro, which is explained as a foreign swordsman's shout to bolster courage.  The female character questions the appropriateness of Momonosuke using it, revealing it's forbidden for him.  The scene includes a large creature in the water in the background.
