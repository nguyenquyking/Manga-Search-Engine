One Piece manga scene depicting Luffy, enraged and shouting "Gya Ha Ha! Mess 'em up!!", with a facial injury.  Another panel shows a close-up of Queen, angered, stating "What does that idiot think he's doing?!".  A third panel illustrates a chaotic scene with multiple characters, likely during a banquet, with Queen observing the commotion and stating "Forget him. We're trying to sneak through this banquet area using these disguises, and look at him..."  The scene also highlights a structural issue with the second-floor balcony, as someone exclaims "Aaah!! There's a crack running through the second floor balcony!!".  The overall scene is tense and action-packed, with a focus on Luffy's disruptive actions and Queen's frustrated reaction.
