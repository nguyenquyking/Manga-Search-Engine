One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Luffy, in a black kimono with white polka dots, is shown mid-air, exclaiming "Byoing!" He appears to be moving swiftly.  A subordinate reports to a large, angry-looking man (likely a Yokozuna) that a woman has cut off the Yokozuna's topknot. The Yokozuna is reacting with shock and disbelief.  The background shows a traditional Japanese-style building.  The overall mood is one of surprise and escalating tension.
