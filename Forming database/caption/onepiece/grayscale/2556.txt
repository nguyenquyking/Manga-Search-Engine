One Piece manga panel depicting Captain Peachbeard, a subordinate of Blackbeard, standing prominently in the foreground, wielding a sword.  He's in the port town of Lulucia Kingdom on the Grand Line.  The background shows a coastal town under attack, with a wrecked navy ship and panicked citizens. Peachbeard's dialogue reveals the King's absence at the Reverie and that he works for Blackbeard.  The panel also includes a text box displaying Peachbeard's bounty (52 million berries).  Other smaller panels show the chaos of the attack and Peachbeard's declaration of his allegiance to Blackbeard.
