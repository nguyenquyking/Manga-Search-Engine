One Piece manga panel depicting Geisha Orobi, in a flowing kimono, performing a dance.  Two other characters, appearing as musicians, critique her performance, with one commenting on her posture ("Lower your hips more!! Your arm is too low!!") and the other expressing dissatisfaction ("Are you dreaming, girl?! I want to see more effort!!"). Orobi, visibly straining, acknowledges their comments ("Yes, ma'am."). The scene is set in a Japanese-style setting, with buildings and a pagoda visible in the background.  Orobi's dance is described as not being fast enough to receive a summons from the Shogun's chamber.
