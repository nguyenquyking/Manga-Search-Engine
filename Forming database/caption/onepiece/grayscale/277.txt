One Piece manga panel depicting multiple characters enjoying soba noodles.  Orobi invites another character (unidentified) to taste the noodles.  Two women are shown enthusiastically eating the noodles, describing the texture and flavor as "amazing" and "satisfyingly chewy al dente." A third, unseen character comments on the situation as "patently ridiculous."  The scene emphasizes the deliciousness of the food through visual effects and onomatopoeia (slurp, gulp, chew).
