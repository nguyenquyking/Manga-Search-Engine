One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Kamazo the Manslayer, a wanted man wielding two large, serrated blades, is the central figure. He is questioned about protecting several women. Zoro is shown in a smaller panel, seemingly engaged in a prior duel.  Another character, possibly an ally of Kamazo, is also present, along with a speech bubble identifying Kamazo as a wanted criminal.  The overall scene is action-packed and tense.
