One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  A female character with pink and white goggles yells "Search everywhere, even in the rafters!!!" Another panel shows Raizo of the Mist, a member of the Nine Red Scabbards, using ninja techniques, escaping with a key, shouting "Nin-nin!"  His escape is depicted with speed lines and motion blur. He states, "I've lived up to the ninja reputation! I have acquired the key!"  Other characters are seen briefly in the background of his escape, appearing to be engaged in combat.
