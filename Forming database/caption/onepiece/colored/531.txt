One Piece manga panel depicting a wounded, large white nine-tailed fox, Onimaru, in a snowy landscape.  A green-skinned character, seemingly a ninja, observes Onimaru.  Text boxes reveal Onimaru was the companion of the deceased Daimyo of Ringo, Shimotsuki Ushimaru.  A second panel shows a smaller version of Onimaru appearing to interact with the same green-skinned character.  The green-skinned character recognizes Onimaru.
