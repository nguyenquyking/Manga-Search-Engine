One Piece manga scene depicting a fierce battle.  A heavily injured, exhausted fighter (possibly Luffy) is shown gasping for breath,  while another figure, Kaido, emerges from a massive explosion and clash.  The scene shows widespread destruction, with crumbling earth and fiery effects.  One panel shows a defeated fighter collapsing. The text indicates the immense power of Kaido and the struggle of the other fighter to resist. The overall tone suggests a critical moment in the battle with a clear power imbalance.
