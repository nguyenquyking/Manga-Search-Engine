One Piece manga panel depicting a Sumo Inferno competition.  A large, obese man with a cigar, likely the announcer or referee, explains the rules: contestants must remain submerged in water until death.  Luffy, visibly frustrated and angry, argues against the rule with the referee, expressing his disdain for the unfair and potentially lethal conditions.  Other sumo wrestlers are visible in the background, and a smaller man with tattoos, possibly a fellow competitor, is also present. The scene emphasizes Luffy's defiance and the dangerous nature of the competition.
