Multiple One Piece characters react to a piece of paper showing the Kozuki clan symbol.  A man with a mustache examines the symbol, a woman holds it, and several others – including a man in a green bandana (likely  Usopp), a man in a blue kimono (possibly Zoro), a man with a killer whale hat, and a hooded, heavily tattooed man – express shock and disbelief.  A smaller panel shows a person examining a similar paper. The final panel displays a large castle, suggesting the Kozuki clan's return.  The overall scene depicts the revelation and reaction to the Kozuki clan's reappearance.
