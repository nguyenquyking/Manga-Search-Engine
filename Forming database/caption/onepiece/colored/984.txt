One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  In the first panel, a character (possibly a subordinate) reports to another, seemingly higher-ranking individual, about being summoned to Shogun Orochi's feast.  The second panel shows a close-up of a character with light blue hair, likely expressing determination or malice. The third panel shows silhouettes of figures behind a shoji screen, with pink petals falling.  The final panel depicts a long shot of the Shogun Orochi's castle in the Flower Capital, Sakyo. Key characters include Shogun Orochi and Komurasaki. The scene suggests anticipation and impending conflict.
