One Piece manga depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Trafalgar Law, visibly strained, declares he will fight, while a nameless character urges escape from a burning castle basement.  Another character, possibly an ally, searches for an exit amidst intense flames.  A large, roaring lion-like creature is shown in the first panel, adding to the overall sense of urgency and danger.  The scene is dynamic, filled with action lines and onomatopoeia indicating clashes and destruction.
