One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  A large, muscular figure with red hair shouts "Crush Kaido, and don't worry about us!!"  Another character, possibly Kaido's subordinate, yells "Go ahead, Straw Haaat!!!" amidst a fiery, chaotic background showing numerous samurai-like figures fighting.  In a separate panel, a bald, bespectacled man expresses disbelief ("And what's wrong with that?"). Another panel shows a character, possibly a samurai, falling into water, exclaiming "Whaaa?! Water?!" while others around him show fear and desperation ("I don't wanna die!!", "Castle Basement").  The overall scene conveys intense action and impending danger.
