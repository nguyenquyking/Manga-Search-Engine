One Piece manga panel depicting the backstory of a character, possibly Pops, and his connection to a village he built.  The scene shows a peaceful village contrasted with text describing lawless islands and orphaned children.  Pops, a large, lion-like figure, is shown in his younger years and as an adult, highlighting his life choices. The narrative explains how he secretly supported the village despite becoming a pirate.  The panel also features a smaller, less prominent character who may be narrating or providing context.  The overall theme is one of hardship, resilience, and the lasting impact of a single individual.
