One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Kaido, in his hybrid dragon form, clashes with a shrouded figure, possibly Luffy.  A powerful purple energy explodes between them.  In smaller panels, a shocked figure (possibly Yamato) cries out "Momo... Father!", while another character observes, exclaiming "CPO?!".  Blood is visible on several characters, suggesting heavy combat. The scene is filled with intense action and dramatic energy effects. "To be continued!" indicates a cliffhanger.
