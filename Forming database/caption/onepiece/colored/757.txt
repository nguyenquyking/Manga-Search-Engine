This One Piece manga panel depicts a narrative about three men—Bingo (priest and undertaker), Bongo (lumber seller), and Bungo (unnamed)—who exploited the aftermath of a fire.  They profited by overcharging grieving families for funerals and selling overpriced wood for rebuilding homes.  The men were secretly infatuated with the beautiful Oiran Komurasaki, who recently passed away.  Their actions, despite being corrupt, went unpunished due to bribery. The panel also shows a woman, possibly Komurasaki, and a reaction from an amused observer to the revealed information, suggesting the expensive gifts were a deliberate act by the Oiran.
