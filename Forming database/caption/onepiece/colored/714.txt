One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Zoro (with a woman in his arms) and Sanji are shown fighting. Sanji is in a striped kimono, using a fiery kick. Zoro, in a white kimono, appears to be protecting the woman.  Other characters, including the Magistrate Slasher, are visible in the background and smaller panels.  The scene is highly dynamic, with motion lines and onomatopoeia emphasizing the action.  The overall context suggests a battle or rescue situation.
