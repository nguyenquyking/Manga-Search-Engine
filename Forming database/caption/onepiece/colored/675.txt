One Piece SBS segment featuring Monkey D. Luffy reacting to a question about the Marine Admirals' naming pattern.  The questioner, Iroha, speculates that Vice Admiral Nay Mingheim is responsible for naming the admirals. The answer confirms this and reveals that Nay Mingheim names other Marines as well.  A second question concerns Izo, a former commander of Whitebeard's 16th division, and his connection to the Nine Red Scabbards and Kozuki Oden.  The answer highlights a flashback scene showing Kinemon and his cohorts captured, and points out Izo's appearance at Marineford and his resemblance to a character in Wano, suggesting links between Whitebeard's crew and Wano.  Images of various Marines, including Nay Mingheim, and panels from a flashback depicting Kin'emon and his group are included.
