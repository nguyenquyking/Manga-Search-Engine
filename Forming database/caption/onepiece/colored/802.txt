One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy, Queen, and other characters. Luffy, bruised but smiling, confidently declares his readiness for more "Oshiruko". Queen, obese and wearing goggles, gleefully proclaims his Oshiruko is his alone.  Other panels show Queen's subordinates bringing him more Oshiruko, and a previous scene showing Queen and a subordinate observing a battle.  The overall scene emphasizes Luffy's tenacity and Queen's gluttony and self-centered nature.
