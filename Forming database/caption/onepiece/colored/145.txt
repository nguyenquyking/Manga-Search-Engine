One Piece manga scene depicting widespread destruction.  The castle's roof is cracking, and the dome is unstable.  A large, blue dragon-like creature is visible amidst the fiery rubble.  Luffy, injured and in pain, is shown reacting to the damage, exclaiming "You Bastard!!" and "That hurt, dammit!!".  The scene suggests significant damage to the castle and island, with a character commenting on the near-total destruction and the years it would take to rebuild.  The dragon's presence implies a powerful force is responsible for the devastation. A speech bubble next to the dragon indicates it's in a "Sad Drunk Phase".
