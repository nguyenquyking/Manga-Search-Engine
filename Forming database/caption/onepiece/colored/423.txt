This One Piece manga panel depicts Kozuki Oden, the Wano Shogun's heir, nonchalantly boiling a pot of oden while others mourn at his father's cremation.  He is eating from the pot with chopsticks, seemingly unfazed by the grief around him.  Other characters present include grieving family members, a samurai attempting to stop Oden, and Grandpa Katsuzoo. The scene is set at a crematorium in the Flower Capital.  The panel highlights the stark contrast between Oden's actions and the somber atmosphere of a funeral.  Speech bubbles convey the shock and outrage of onlookers at Oden's behavior.
