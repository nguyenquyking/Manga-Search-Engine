One Piece manga depicting Luffy in Gear 5, unleashing a powerful attack.  The scene shows Luffy, heavily injured but determined, delivering a devastating blow.  The impact creates a massive explosion and sends shockwaves throughout the panel.  His opponent, a large, dark, dragon-like creature, is visibly affected by the attack.  Luffy's speech bubbles express his determination ("Let's finish this up!!") and a brief apology. The final panel indicates the chapter's end ("To be continued!").  The visual style is dynamic, with exaggerated expressions and action lines highlighting the intensity of the fight.
