One Piece manga scene depicting the aftermath of a raid at Skull Dome's front entrance.  Nekomamushi, in his Sulong form, is shown with a large, prominent tongue.  Pedro is seen collapsed, with Nekomamushi commenting on the beauty of the full moon.  The scene highlights the crucial role Pedro played in the raid's success, as without him, Luffy and the others would not have survived.  Other characters present include a surprised-looking female character, likely a subordinate of Nekomamushi, and a text box indicating that this is Pedro's last moon.
