One Piece manga panel depicting the Flower Capital in Wano Country.  A large, central castle-like structure is surrounded by numerous smaller buildings, cherry blossoms, and bridges.  The panel also shows several smaller scenes: townspeople reacting to news of a ghost sighting, a wanted poster of Kamazo the Manslayer, and a report of a murder in District Two.  Kamazo is identified as the culprit, though he remains elusive.  The overall scene suggests a blend of traditional Japanese architecture and supernatural elements.
