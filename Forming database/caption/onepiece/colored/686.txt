One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  One character, with red hair and goggles, is recounting a past event where he was attacked but didn't flee.  He is speaking to another character whose face is largely obscured by bandages.  The dialogue reveals the red-haired character was restrained by seastone cuffs, and the bandaged character's laughter angered someone powerful enough to inflict significant injury.  The scene also shows a large-scale battle in the background, indicating a chaotic fight. The red-haired character is likely Shanks, and the bandaged character could be Orochi. The scene focuses on their post-battle discussion and revelations about past events.
