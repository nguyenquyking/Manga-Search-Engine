One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blonde-haired character in a dark robe is impaled and falls to the ground with blood spattering, indicated by the word "THUD".  Below, four other characters react; three with expressions of shock or glee, and one with a wide, open-mouthed grin.  One of these characters appears to wield a long staff.  The overall scene suggests a violent confrontation, with the fallen character likely defeated.
