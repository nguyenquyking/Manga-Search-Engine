One Piece SBS corner featuring Nami and Perospero.  Nami is shown in a panel explaining a chemical structure, possibly related to Perospero's candy. Another panel shows Perospero's reaction to Nami, possibly licking her.  A separate section discusses Shakky, a former pirate, and her possible connection to Garp and a mysterious "Rox."  The overall theme is reader questions and Oda's humorous responses.
