One Piece manga scene depicting Yamato, a female character with white hair and horns, running urgently through a basement armory while multiple large gunpowder barrels, marked with skull and crossbones, are present.  Another character, possibly a mink, attempts to stop her.  A large, fiery sun-like object dominates the background, suggesting imminent danger. Yamato's urgent actions are emphasized by speed lines and onomatopoeia. The scene implies a high-stakes situation where the gunpowder barrels pose a significant threat, and Yamato is trying to reach a specific location. Namuji Hyoga is mentioned, potentially indicating another character's involvement or a technique being used.
