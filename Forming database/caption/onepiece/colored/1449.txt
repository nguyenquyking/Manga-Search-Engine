One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of intense heat.  A large, fiery figure shouts "Out of my way, fish!!!" while causing a boiling sea, affecting several smaller characters who react with expressions of pain and fear.  One character exclaims, "He's boiling the seawater!!" Another character, possibly a Straw Hat, expresses relief, stating, "Good! We're in time!!"  In the background, a large, cake-like structure, possibly Mont d'Or, is shown with text stating "The Queen Mama Chanter will be arriving soon." The overall scene suggests a dangerous situation where the Straw Hats are narrowly escaping a powerful enemy.
