One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy, severely injured, being supported by an older male character (likely Grandpa). Luffy apologizes for his failed attack.  The scene shows a powerful Haki-based attack, with a focus on its internal and external destructive capabilities, and its potential defensive use as an invisible armor.  The older man is angered by someone eating Oshiruko, implying a previous event.  The panel displays text boxes explaining the nature of Haki and its application.
