One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy, visibly exhausted ("Pant...Pant..."), confronting a large, muscular figure, possibly a member of the Beasts Pirates, who is drinking from a large barrel.  Luffy questions his drinking. The larger figure explains the capital is celebrating the Fire Festival.  Another panel shows Onigashima approaching in the distance.  The scene takes place on Onigashima.  The larger figure states he is having fun and continues to drink.  The overall mood is tense, but also highlights a festive atmosphere contrasted with Luffy's frustration.
