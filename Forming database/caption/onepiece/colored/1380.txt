This One Piece manga page features Rob Lucci, CP9's agent of "dark justice,"  described as a cold killer who prioritizes justice above all else.  A panel shows him using his Finger Pistol technique.  Another CP9 agent, Kaku, is also highlighted, showcasing his mastery of the Four Sword Style and his Ox-Ox Fruit Giraffe Model. The text explains the Water Seven arc's context: the Straw Hats' attempt to rescue Robin from the World Government and their impending war against the government.  A small panel depicts Kaku's "Giraffe Blast" attack.  A bird, possibly a pet or messenger, is perched on Lucci's shoulder.
