One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Babanuki, the Excavation Labor Camp Chief Warden, uses his Elephant Smile fruit powers to unleash "Elephant's Marchoo," a powerful attack.  The attack is depicted as a swirling, elephant-trunk-like projectile labeled "Bwe-Choonk."  A character (possibly Luffy) is shown reacting to the attack with a pained expression and sound effect "Aaah!!".  Another character is seen launching an attack labeled "Pawoo Pawoo Pa Papapa!!" which appears to precede Babanuki's attack, possibly indicating a counter-attack or support action.  Babanuki’s dialogue references the overwhelming power of his attack.
