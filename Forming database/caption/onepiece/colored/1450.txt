One Piece manga panel depicting Big Mom eating a cake.  The panels show her expressions and sounds ("Mmm!", "Gulp!", "Chomp!", "Fhuff!") as she devours it.  She comments on the extraordinary taste, describing it as dreamlike and unlike anything she's experienced. The cake is elaborately decorated, resembling a castle.  Small figures are seen marching on the cake.  A later panel shows a glimpse inside Big Mom's mouth, revealing a dark, possibly macabre scene. Text indicates this bizarre taste is inexplicably linked to "dead puppies dancing merry."
