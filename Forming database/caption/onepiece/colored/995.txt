One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where prisoners, including Old Man Hyo, are forced to move large stone blocks for meager food rations (one millet dumpling for every five blocks).  A large, muscular guard threatens to crush anyone obstructing him.  The scene emphasizes the harsh conditions and punishment within the prison.  Old Man Hyo is visibly weak and warned against resistance.  Another prisoner receives four tickets, possibly representing a reward or punishment. The overall tone is one of oppression and struggle for survival.
