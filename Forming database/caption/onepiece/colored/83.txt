One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  A large, horned, blue-skinned character, possibly a fish-man, labeled "Drunk-en Beggar," gestures dramatically, stating "Just Staaahp."  He is facing a dark-haired character, likely Luffy, who is visibly angry and asks, "Are you still drunk?!"

The scene is intense and action-packed, with dynamic lines and visual effects enhancing the impact.  Luffy contemplates copying the Drunk-en Beggar's abilities, questioning "What if I try copying you...?"
