One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene in a town.  Top panel shows a wide shot of a town with many buildings, with text indicating "Sangoro the Rebel" and "Zorojuro the Criminal."  The middle panel shows Zoro, Sanji, and a small child (likely Tama) running through the town; Sanji says "Sorry, I don't have time to waste with you, Browgoro" while Zoro replies "Right back at you, Mossjuro!" and the child laughs. The bottom panel features a large, reptilian-looking character (likely Kawamatsu) making an entrance, causing Toko to react with fear and a speech bubble saying "Toko...".  The text indicates Kawamatsu's arrival is dramatic. The overall scene is one of action and confrontation.
