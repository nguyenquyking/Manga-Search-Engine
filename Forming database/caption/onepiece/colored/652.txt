A One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of chaos and impending disaster.  A large, matronly figure with elaborate headwear warns of an unpredictable disaster, urging evacuation and abandonment of posts.  Several fleeing, muscular, shirtless men with dark complexions and distinctive hairstyles are shown reacting to this warning. In a separate panel, Luffy, with a collar around his neck, and an elderly man with a flame-like hairstyle discuss the "tasty" Oshiruko. Luffy expresses a desire to eat it again, and the elderly man warns him.  The overall mood is one of urgency and impending danger, contrasted with Luffy's seemingly nonchalant reaction to the situation.
