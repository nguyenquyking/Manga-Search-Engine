A One Piece manga panel depicting a meeting between a pirate and the Five Elders in the Hall of Power, Pangea Castle.  Shanks, a prominent pirate, requests to speak to the Five Elders about a pirate.  St. Donquixote Mjosgard, a World Noble, is also present, offering his power.  The scene includes dialogue revealing Mjosgard's past connection to the late Queen Otohime.  The Five Elders are shown seated, and a female character (likely Vivi) reacts with surprise. The overall atmosphere is tense and significant.
