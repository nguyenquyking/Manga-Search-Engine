One Piece manga scene depicting multiple characters and interactions.  A sick individual, possibly Luffy, lies on the ground while Chopper examines him, attempting to find an antidote.  Other characters, including Momonosuke,  a young girl (possibly Hiyori), and others, express concern or anger.  A later panel shows a group of prisoners, possibly awaiting Luffy, with a muscular, possibly important figure highlighted.  Dialogue reveals arguments about the seriousness of the situation and accusations of cowardice.
