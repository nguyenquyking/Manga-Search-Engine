One Piece manga panel depicting the disowning of a Shogun.  A large, muscular man in orange and purple samurai attire, possibly Oden, is being banished from the Flower Capital. He carries two swords and expresses his hunger and indifference to his disownment, stating he will find a new place to live.  Another man with purple hair, likely a higher-ranking official, appears pained by the decision.  The panel also shows a bustling city scene in the background, and text boxes indicating the event happened when Oden was 18.
