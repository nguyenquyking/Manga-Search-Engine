The scene shows a landscape with broken stone pillars, suggesting a battle aftermath or significant event.  The dialogue boxes reveal their intent to take the heads of Kaido and Shogun Orochi, marking the mission's objective. The pink-haired character expresses confidence in Lord Oden's plan, while others contemplate the meaning behind a twenty-year delay.
