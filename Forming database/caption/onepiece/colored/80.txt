One Piece manga scene depicting a battle and a festival.  A character in white is defeating an opponent, who is bleeding profusely, with a sword.  The defeated character is labeled with "Doom!!" and "Urgh!!!". The scene transitions to a festival in the Flower Capital, where people are lighting sky lanterns. An older man, possibly a festival leader, is shown laughing and helping launch the lanterns.  The text indicates wishes are being sent into the sky.  The overall tone is energetic and celebratory, juxtaposed with the preceding violent battle.
