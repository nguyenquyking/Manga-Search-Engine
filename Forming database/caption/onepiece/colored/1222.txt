One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters and actions.  A large, red-faced character with a long nose shouts "YOU'RE A LIAR, BIG BRO!!!" at a shocked purple-haired woman who exclaims "IT CAN'T BE TRUE!!!" in response. The scene is set amidst a large, ancient tree in a bamboo forest.  A subsequent panel shows Luffy and a winged, masked figure (likely related to the previous scene). Finally, a woman, possibly the purple-haired one from the earlier panel, is shown passed out and crying, with text indicating Ace's prior presence in Wano.
