One Piece manga panel depicting Dracule Mihawk and a pink-haired woman, possibly Perona.  Mihawk is seated regally, reading a newspaper, while Perona angrily expresses her departure, referencing past favors she's done for him (providing food and shelter). A later panel shows Perona's sarcastic farewell as Mihawk contemplates an "odd subject" that has arisen at the Reverie.  The scene emphasizes their complex relationship and hints at an upcoming plot development.
