One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in Udon.  A shocked, large, cigar-smoking man reacts to news, possibly about Komurasaki's death.  He's being told to hook up a Light-Scroll Snail.  In another panel, a group of people react to this news, with a balloon-like figure visible. A large excavation labor camp is visible in the background. A light-scroll snail is shown delivering the message.  The overall mood is tense and reveals the setting to be Udon prison.
