One Piece manga panel depicting a contagious plague outbreak.  Prisoners are shown exhibiting symptoms (fever, burning sensation).  A masked man, seemingly the source, laughs and warns of the plague's contagious nature via contact. He is armed and threatens violence against anyone interfering. The plague spreads rapidly, with other prisoners falling ill. The scene is chaotic and emphasizes the danger of the contagious disease.  The masked man's actions suggest he is either intentionally spreading the disease or is afflicted with it and unaware of the danger he poses.
