One Piece manga panel depicting the aftermath of X. Drake's attack on Amigasa, the Village of Woven Hats.  The village is shown in ruins, with destroyed buildings and a large, central tree bearing a shrine.  A portrait of X. Drake is included.  The narration explains that only two villagers remain and that the countryside is a wasteland due to Kaido's forces.  The panel shifts to show a portion of the Flower Capital, where Shogun Orochi resides, as the only flourishing area in Wano.  Luffy is visible in the background of this latter scene.
