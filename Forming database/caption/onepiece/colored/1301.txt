One Piece manga panel depicting Zoro Juro, a Ronin, in a white kimono, handling a small wooden box containing the remains of legendary swordsman Ryuma.  Another man, seemingly a government official, observes him with a stern expression. The scene takes place twenty-three years ago amidst a pirate upheaval.  The populace is terrified of Zoro Juro's actions.  The panel also shows Zoro Juro's serious expression and mentions his legendary sword, Shusui.  A panel in the background shows a peaceful ceremony interrupted by the grave robbing.
