One Piece manga panel depicting a Q&A section.  The question asks about the change from beer mugs to barrels for drinking beer, and the answer explains it's for visual appeal and to comply with Japanese laws regarding underage drinking. The second question asks for depictions of Roronoa Zoro at ages 40 and 60.  The answer shows two versions of Zoro at 40: one wielding four swords, the other older and injured.  At 60, Zoro is shown wielding five swords and an alternate future where he is old, begging for money.  The panel includes small illustrations of beer mugs and barrels.
