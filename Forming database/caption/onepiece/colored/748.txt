One Piece manga panel depicting reactions to the revelation of the "Witching Hour Boy's" identity.  A woman with teal hair expresses shock, stating it "cannot be."  Another character, seemingly Luffy, reacts with surprise, learning the boy is Tonoyasu, who is revealed to be a popular figure in Ebisu Town, known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.  A child, possibly Tonoyasu's daughter, excitedly exclaims "That's my Daddy!!!"  The scene also shows a funeral procession for Komurasaki, implying a connection to the overall narrative.  The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga.
