One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A child, possibly a devil child, is being carried by a masked figure while laughing maniacally.  Other characters, including an elderly woman, observe.  In a subsequent panel, a large, shadowy figure attacks, causing an explosion and fiery debris. A dragon-like creature then appears, demanding "Straw Hat" (Luffy) to come down.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
