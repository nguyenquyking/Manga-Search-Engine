A large, blue dragon-like creature, possibly a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user, overlooks the ruins of Oden Castle.  The creature is enraged, referring to the Straw Hat Pirates (Luffy and Law are shown in a newspaper clipping) as "little brats" for stealing its Smile fruits.  The scene shows the castle ruins amidst a village, with a large torii gate visible.  A large, pink-haired, obese man, wielding a katana, is also present, seemingly pursuing the Straw Hats. He is shouting and determined to stop them. The overall scene depicts a confrontation at Oden Castle's ruins, with a powerful creature and a determined warrior against the Straw Hats.
