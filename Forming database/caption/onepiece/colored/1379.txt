This One Piece manga page depicts Charlos, a Celestial Dragon, known for abusing his power and tormenting slaves.  He's shown attempting to hunt a mermaid.  Another panel shows Stelly, a Goa Kingdom Noble and Sabo's foster brother, who secretly mocks Sabo.  Text boxes provide background information on the Three Brothers (Luffy, Ace, and Sabo) and the Sabaody Archipelago.  The overall scene contrasts the cruelty of the Celestial Dragons with the brotherly bond of Luffy, Ace, and Sabo.
