Another panel shows Luffy, wounded and on the ground, addressed by Kaido as "Pirate Hunter."  Kaido's subordinate, Prometheus, is ordered to attack Luffy, launching fire.  Subsequent panels show Kaido injecting something into Prometheus, who then releases a volley of projectiles at Luffy.  The scene is chaotic, filled with rubble and smoke, indicating a violent clash.
