This is the cover of One Piece Volume 95, "Oden's Adventure".  The image features Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist, smiling broadly while holding a large piece of roasted meat. He's wearing his signature straw hat and red captain's coat, which is somewhat torn, revealing his muscular chest.  A seagull wearing a pirate hat is perched on a scroll bearing the One Piece title. The author's name, Eiichiro Oda, is visible at the bottom.
