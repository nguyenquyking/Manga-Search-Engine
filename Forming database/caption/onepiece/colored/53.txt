One Piece manga colorized panel depicting a fierce battle.  A large, seemingly rubbery character (likely Luffy in Gear 5) with white hair and a wide grin attacks a dark-haired opponent (possibly Kaido).  The rubbery character unleashes a powerful attack, indicated by sound effects like "BOIYOING," "ZWOOP," and "DOOM,"  resulting in a large explosion and the opponent being sent flying.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia expressing the impact of the attack, ending with the attacker's triumphant "ZERO!!!" and the opponent's pained "HRGGG...". The colorization enhances the intensity of the fight.
