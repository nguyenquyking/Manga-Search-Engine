One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation about Kozuki Oden's loyal retainers, the Nine Red Scabbards.  A character, possibly a villain, recounts the Scabbards' immense strength.  Another character expresses disbelief that they are all dead, while a third recalls Kin'emon, their leader, as a brilliant man. The scene shows various characters reacting to the news of the Scabbards' return 20 years after Oden's death.  The setting appears to be a celebratory or festive environment within a Japanese-style building.  The panel also includes text boxes explaining the passage of time since Oden's death and the impending threat posed by the Scabbards' return.
