One Piece manga scene depicting a cruel game orchestrated by a large, muscular, cigar-smoking man. Two bound prisoners, with blond and red hair respectively, are submerged in water via a pulley system.  Spectators, including several uniformed individuals, watch and react with laughter and expressions of shock. The large man gleefully proclaims his amusement, while the prisoners struggle and sputter.  The overall tone is violent and darkly humorous.
