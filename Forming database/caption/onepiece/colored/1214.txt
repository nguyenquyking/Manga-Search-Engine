One Piece manga panel depicting multiple simultaneous battles during the Tower Climb.  Zoro engages a large, monstrous opponent, deflecting a barrage of nails.  Simultaneously, Hawkins is shown injured, while another panel shows Zoro protecting a smaller character, possibly a civilian.  A large, ghostly figure with long white hair attacks using a ripple-like energy wave, and another character, possibly Basil Hawkins, observes the scene with a grim expression. The panels depict intense action and multiple conflicts occurring at once within the Tower Climb arc.
