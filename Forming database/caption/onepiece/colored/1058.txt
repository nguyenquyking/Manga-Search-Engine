One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large, menacing blue dragon-like creature looms over a smaller, rotund character,  who appears to be riding a black bull.  The rotund character, possibly  a member of the Beasts Pirates, is shown negotiating, possibly with the dragon. Text bubbles indicate a past encounter and a proposal for cooperation.  Another character, smaller and seemingly more subservient, is present in the background.  The scene is set in a rustic, possibly war-torn environment.  Visual elements such as the dragon's imposing size and the character's expressions convey tension and a sense of impending action.
