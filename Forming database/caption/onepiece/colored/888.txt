One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene and subsequent investigation.  Several ninjas attack a cloaked figure, causing it to disintegrate into purple particles.  A female ninja with purple hair and skull hair ornaments observes, along with other characters including a large, green-clad ninja and a pink creature.  The scene shifts to a corridor where a lone figure walks away; another character, a woman with dark hair, observes, relieved that she only used a clone.  Text suggests a search for the original body of the disintegrated figure, questioning if it's ninjutsu, sorcery, or a spirit.
