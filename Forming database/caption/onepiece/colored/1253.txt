One Piece manga panel depicting Otama, a young girl in a patched green kimono, interacting with Luffy and other characters.  Otama initially strikes a surrender pose, then offers Luffy some of her time. Luffy is present in the background, seemingly amused or curious.  Another scene shows Otama popping a ball (possibly a kibi dango) into a baboon's mouth.  The baboon is large and white with red fur around its face. Text bubbles indicate dialogue and actions, including “Surrender Pose,” “Eat Up, Baboon!”, and “Pling!”. Mil-let Dum is also seen in the final panel.
