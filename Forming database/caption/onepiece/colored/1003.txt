One Piece manga scene depicting Perona, the Thriller Bark Pirates' Ghost Princess, reacting to the news of Gecko Moria's survival.  Perona is shown crying tears of joy, while a man, likely her companion, sits calmly on a throne, unimpressed. The background shows the ruins of Muggy Kingdom on the Grand Line, where Moria was last seen.  A newspaper clipping shows Moria and his zombie army. The scene highlights Perona's strong emotional response to Moria's return, contrasted with the other character's indifference.
