One Piece manga panel depicting a plan to raid Kaido's base on Onigashima.  Luffy, alongside other unnamed crew members (one appearing to be a child in traditional Japanese clothing and another with a straw hat), are shown preparing for a raid two weeks hence, on the night of the Fire Festival.  A separate panel shows a group including Brook, Nami, and other characters strategizing in a dimly lit room.  The overall scene emphasizes secrecy and planning for a large-scale attack.
