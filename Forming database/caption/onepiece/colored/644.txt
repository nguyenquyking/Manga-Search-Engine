One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring several panels.  The first shows a caricatured drawing of a bathhouse scene with exaggerated female figures. The text discusses Sanada, described as a pervert, wanting to work at a bathhouse.  Subsequent panels show Sanada's inappropriate behavior and requests, with other characters reacting negatively.  Another question concerns a tree growing from Shutenmaru's head, referencing a rakugo story called Atamayama. Oda's humorous response indicates the tree grows from his crotch.  The overall scene depicts a humorous Q&A section with discussions of bathhouses, inappropriate behavior, and a rakugo story.
