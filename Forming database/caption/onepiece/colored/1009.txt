One Piece manga panel depicting Catarina Devon, the sixth ship captain of the Blackbeard Pirates, a Devil Fruit user with a Nine-Tailed Fox model. She is shown standing triumphantly, holding a sword, while other Blackbeard pirates celebrate in the background.  Devon's dialogue indicates that they have captured someone and are discussing what to do with the body. A horrified Devon's subordinate is shown in a separate panel. Another character, possibly a Blackbeard pirate, is shown in a lower panel, suggesting malicious intent.  The scene is dynamic with action lines and speech bubbles showing excitement and a sense of impending threat.
