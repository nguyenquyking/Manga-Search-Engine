One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Armed samurai are surprised their guns are ineffective against a powerful figure, possibly Franky (implied by the speech bubble "Who is that carpenter?").  Another character, appearing strong and possibly a protector, is defending someone, stating they stole Lord Yasue. Nami and Robin are shown in the bottom panel, seemingly involved in the conflict.  The overall scene suggests a robbery and ensuing confrontation.
