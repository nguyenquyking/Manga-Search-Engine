One Piece manga panel depicting several scenes.  The first shows a tense discussion between a man with dark skin and dark hair (possibly Ashura) and two others, one seemingly a mink, discussing a failed plan.  The second panel shows a large, muscular man (likely a member of the Head Mountain Thieves Brigade) with bandages and a lion-head belt buckle, being told to activate something called a "light-scroll snail."  The third panel shows the same large man, apparently pleased that the Head Mountain Thieves Brigade has caused arson in Bakura Town, Kuri. The final panel shows a note indicating the Thieves Brigade was present.  The overall theme is conflict and a thwarted plan, resulting in arson and destruction.
