One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A large, shadowy figure wielding a giant scythe, labeled "Clawing Guillotine," attacks a blonde-haired character. This shadowy figure is using "The Annihilation Card". The blonde-haired character, possibly a Straw Hat, is shown reacting, and text indicates a battle's result is being determined by cards.  Other panels show onlookers reacting to a defeated Straw Hat, suggesting a previous event.  The scene is intense and action-packed, highlighting a powerful attack and the stakes of the battle.
