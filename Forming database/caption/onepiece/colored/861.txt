One Piece manga panel depicting several scenes.  The first shows stylized banners with kanji representing sumo wrestlers' names (Jango, Hyozo, Kaido, Gedatsu, Pagaya, Kuroobi, Gaimon) within the Wano Country arc. A subsequent panel displays a bathhouse scene with Nami and Robin in various states of undress, illustrating a mixed bathing setting within the Flower Capital.  Oda Sensei is depicted reacting to a reader's question about the bathhouse, showing a nosebleed and expressing displeasure at the mixed bathing scene's inclusion.
