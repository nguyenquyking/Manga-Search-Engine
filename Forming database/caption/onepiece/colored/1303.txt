Zoro, using a Seppuku blade, attacks a character (likely Kin'emon) in a Japanese-style setting.  Rose petals are scattered around, indicating a dramatic moment.  Other characters react with shock and horror.  A character, possibly a woman playing a shamisen, observes the scene.  Blood is visible, confirming the attack's severity. Another character smells blood and identifies Zoro as the killer.
