One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, brown, Brachio-like creature, possibly a Zoan Devil Fruit user, attacks Queen, a large, obese woman in a pink dress, smashing her into rubble.  Text indicates Queen is defeated ("BOMBER!!!", "HE GOT HER!!!"). Other characters cheer or react in the background.  Queen's expression shows pain and surprise. The panel also includes narrative text boxes detailing Queen's perspective on recent events.
