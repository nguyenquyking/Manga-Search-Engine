One Piece manga scene depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A large, monstrous entity (possibly the Mountain God) is shown attacking someone in a yellow and gold outfit, who is seemingly impaled.  A blonde-haired man in a dark purple and gold kimono, possibly a samurai, yells "Give Tsuru back!!" and threatens to slice open the stomach of the attacker.  Another man warns against harming the Mountain God, stating Wano will be ruined.  In a separate panel, two men, possibly Kin'emon and another character, watch in horror as the monster attacks, with one yelling for Kin'emon to stop.  The scene is filled with action lines and onomatopoeia indicating impact and damage.
