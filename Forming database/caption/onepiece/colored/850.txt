One Piece manga panel depicting Big Mom and a small character, possibly Chopper, interacting on a beach near a large sharkygator.  Big Mom is large, wearing a pink dress and a pirate hat, and is seated on the sharkygator.  Chopper is much smaller and appears to be drooling.  The scene takes place in the Wasteland of Kuri. Dialogue bubbles reveal Big Mom's surprise at meeting Chopper, and her comments on the people of Okobore Town.  The panel also shows a flashback of Big Mom's previous encounter with the sharkygator.
