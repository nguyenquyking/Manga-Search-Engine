One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where several characters are wearing restrictive collars. A large, obese man with blond hair and a cigar, possibly a Sumo wrestler or similar authority figure, demonstrates the collars' function by smashing a stone pillar replica.  The pillar breaks violently upon impact.  Other characters, including Luffy who is shown visibly struggling with the collar, react with shock and fear.  The text emphasizes the collars' inescapable and deadly nature, capable of decapitation.  The scene is action-packed, highlighting the danger and tension.
