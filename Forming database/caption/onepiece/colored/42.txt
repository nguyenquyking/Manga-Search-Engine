One Piece manga scene depicting Yamato, with her characteristic horns and white hair, reacting with a surprised and open-mouthed expression.  A large, blue dragon-like creature inflates, labeled "BALLOON!!", then deflates with a "FWOOP!!" sound effect. The dragon experiences a "GAAAH!!!" and "URRRGH!!!" as it inflates and then deflates, respectively, suggesting pain or distress.  A smaller, pink dragon's head is visible in a panel below Yamato, possibly showing a reaction to the larger dragon's actions.  The overall scene shows intense action and the large dragon's dramatic transformation.
