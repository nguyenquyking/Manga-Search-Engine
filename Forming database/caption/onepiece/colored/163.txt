Panel 2 shows a fiery duel on the 3rd floor between Raizo and an opponent (likely within Onigashima).  Raizo is releasing a paralysis jutsu. Panel 3 shows a loyal retainer of Oden-Sama, defiant in the face of death by fire.  Another character looks on, seemingly pleased by the outcome. The overall scene depicts intense action and conflict within the Onigashima raid.
