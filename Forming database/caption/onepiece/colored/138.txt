One Piece manga depiction of Kaido, heavily damaged,  declares he's beaten but intends to quickly finish the fight.  He's shown in a large panel, emanating pink energy and surrounded by flames.  Smaller panels show Hera requesting to be taken to the roof, and Law using Anaesthesia to create a K-Room portal.  The scene is set in a burning building with a bridge visible in the background.  Luffy's presence is implied through Kaido's dialogue.
