One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation. Three large, muscular men, possibly the  "Bounties" (Boutou is visible on one's vest), argue over a prisoner, Kawamatsu, a woman with pink hair and a yellow kimono,  whose head is desired by the men.  Another scene shows a cloaked figure confronting the three men, and it's revealed this figure is a legendary samurai who enjoys poisoned fish.  A ninja escapes, and Kawamatsu is attacked.  The panels show  the action's intensity and the characters' reactions.
