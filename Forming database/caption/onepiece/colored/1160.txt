One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Urashima, a large, enraged sumo wrestler-like character with pink hair and tattoos, is about to strike a smaller female character with a powerful "Far Bank Slap."  The woman, appearing terrified, is dressed in a yellow kimono.  Luffy, identifiable by his straw hat (partially visible) and signature grin, is observing the scene.  Urashima's attack is described as sending the target to the afterlife.  The panel shows intense action and a power imbalance between the characters.
