Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A dark, swirling storm clouds over a village.  Trafalgar Law, visibly concerned, is shown in multiple panels.  He is seen reacting to the storm and a message summoning the Straw Hat Pirates.  Other Straw Hats are also depicted, along with a wounded, masked figure who questions the situation.  The overall scene depicts impending danger and a call to action for the Straw Hats.
