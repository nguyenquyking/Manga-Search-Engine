One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  Luffy expresses concern ("Luffy, No!!") as Momonosuke, urged by an unseen character ("Do it, Momo!!"), prepares to move Onigashima, a giant skull-shaped island.  Momonosuke is shown with a determined expression, his dragon form partially visible.  A large, fiery dragon-like creature, likely Momonosuke's full transformation, is depicted in the main panel, its powerful movement implied by dynamic lines and fiery effects.  Onigashima is shown in the background, seemingly being moved.  Another character is seen expressing surprise ("What?!?"). The overall scene conveys intense action and impending conflict.
