One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Top panels show Dr. Kureha, a 141-year-old doctor, tending to Nami, and Dalton, the King of Cherry Blossom Kingdom, alongside Luffy and other characters.  Middle panels show excited reactions to Luffyland and a question directed at Dalton. Bottom panels feature a character (possibly Luffy) anticipating an attack from above at Impel Down, level 6, within a solitary cell, surrounded by sea creatures.  The scene highlights the contrast between the cheerful atmosphere of Cherry Blossom and the ominous setting of Impel Down.
