Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A chaotic scene unfolds as Drake, transformed into a rampaging dinosaur, wreaks havoc.  Civilians flee in terror as Drake attacks.  In another panel, a character resembling Zoro is seen fighting alongside another character who uses explosive-like attacks against Drake. Sanji is also present, narrowly avoiding Drake's attack.  The overall scene depicts intense action and destruction caused by Drake's rampage.
