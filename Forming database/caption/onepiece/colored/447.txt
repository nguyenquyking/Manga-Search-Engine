One Piece manga panel depicting a scene unfolding over two time periods.  The first shows a shadowy figure, possibly Oden, addressing a group of his vassals, including Roger, preparing to open Wano Country in over 20 years.  The vassals are enthusiastically raising their weapons. The second shows a time skip of twenty-five years, with drummers playing rhythmically aboard a ship, possibly signifying a significant event. The overall tone is one of anticipation and action.
