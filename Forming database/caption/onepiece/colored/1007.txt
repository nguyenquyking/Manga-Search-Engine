Below, the Blackbeard Pirates are seen, with Moria expressing concern about them.  Meanwhile,  a scene shows a lion-like character, possibly a Blackbeard pirate, with a female companion, in a joyful setting.  The final panel shows a violent action sequence, likely Absalom being attacked.  The overall scene is a mix of reunion, concern, and action.
