One Piece manga panel depicting Onigashima's approach to Wano's mainland.  Luffy, visibly strained and shouting, is shown with his arms raised.  Other characters, possibly his crew, are seen in the background.  A timer indicates only 15 minutes remain.  Onigashima, shaped like a giant skull, looms large over a section of Wano's Flower Capital, illuminated with lanterns.  The scene conveys urgency and impending conflict.
