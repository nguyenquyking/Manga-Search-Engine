A large, muscular, horned figure, possibly Kaido, stands over several defeated individuals.  One is lying on the ground, apparently knocked unconscious and bleeding.  Other characters, including a blond-haired man and others with darker hair and clothing, look on in shock and concern.  The scene depicts a powerful display of strength, with the large figure's size and the others' injured state highlighting his dominance.  The text bubbles suggest uncertainty about the large figure's motivations.  The overall scene is one of post-conflict, focusing on the aftermath of a fight and the reactions of those involved.
