One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion about the upcoming Fire Festival in the Flower Capital.  Shinobu and another character (possibly Law's crew member) observe preparations for the festival, noting it's inappropriate given the recent deaths of two important people.  The scene shows numerous sky boats being constructed.  Another panel shows sketches of Sanji and Shinobu, labeled "Likeness."  The overall mood is somber, contrasting the festive preparations.
