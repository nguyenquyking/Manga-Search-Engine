One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A large, lion-like figure with yellow fur, possibly a mink, attacks a character with dark hair and a red and white striped outfit, yelling "GLEAH!!"  The lion figure declares, "I'm here to avenge Pedro!!" and "Let's take this outside!!".  In subsequent panels, the same lion-like figure chases another character, stating "You're not gonna get away!".  A separate scene shows a group of characters reacting to the discovery of Roronoa Zoro, with one shouting, "There he is! Roronoa Zoro!", urging others to flee ("They found us!! Run!!").  Another character is seen desperately trying to protect Zoro.
