This One Piece SBS Corner features two distinct scenes.  The first shows a stylized chibi-like depiction of Sanadacchi, overjoyed, holding a Guinness World Record certificate for the world's largest collection of One Piece merchandise (5,656 items).  Oda's response playfully acknowledges the achievement despite Sanadacchi's self-described "pervert" status on YouTube.  The second scene depicts Usopp with a toad named Boingnosuke perched on his head.  The caption explains Boingnosuke's arrival, having jumped onto Usopp's head to escape a snake.
