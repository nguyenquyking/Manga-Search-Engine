Another samurai, with a straw hat, urges them to "Run!!".  A woman with dark hair cries, clutching a pistol.  A large, muscular man with dark skin and dreadlocks declares he'll deal with Oden's son, Momonosuke, himself.  In another panel, a fierce-looking samurai yells "Kuri!!" as a large shadow looms. The text indicates the samurai's intention to protect Momonosuke. The overall scene suggests a dramatic escape and impending conflict.
