One Piece manga panel depicting a scene at a dock.  Wanted posters of Carpenter Franosuke, Shachi, and two unnamed individuals are displayed.  A group of people, including a man with a large nose and headphones and a woman in a kimono, are being examined against the likeness posters by Brook, the skeleton musician, who approves their identities with "Very Well! Pass!!". Other characters are present, including two men who are concerned and believe the group is haunted by a ghost. The map shows the location as between the Flower Capital and Kuri, specifically at a dock near Udon.
