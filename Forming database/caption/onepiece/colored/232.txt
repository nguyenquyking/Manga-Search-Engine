One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between a large, horned, dark-skinned character and a smaller, light-skinned character with white hair and horns. The larger character shouts "Shut up!!" while the smaller character protests "I'm not!!".  The scene also shows flashbacks of the smaller character (Oni Princess) alone and offering food and a blanket to the larger character (likely Kaido), who reflects on past samurai encounters and lost friends.  The visual style is typical One Piece manga with dramatic action lines and speech bubbles.
