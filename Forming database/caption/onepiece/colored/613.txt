One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A large, dark-skinned warrior with elaborate shoulder armor shouts "Pawoo Pawoo, Pa Pa Pa!" as he gestures dramatically.  Another character, possibly a chief warden, pleads, "No! Chief Warden, not that!!"  Meanwhile, a smaller character warns, "Hey!! Babunuki's going to shoot something this way!!"  In another panel, a large, angry character with a gaping mouth declares "Too Late!!!"  A smaller character with green skin and a straw hat observes, "I saw a pretty bad future just now..."  Luffy is shown briefly in the bottom right panel, seemingly involved in combat with a large elephant-like creature.  The overall scene is one of impending danger and urgency.
