One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of chaos and concern in Wano.  The top panel shows a panoramic view of Wano Country, with text indicating Lord Oden is missing, and Whitebeard's ship is also gone. The subsequent panels show characters reacting to this news:  Thatch, Izo, a distressed woman (likely Tama), and other unnamed individuals.  A separate panel illustrates a large ship sailing away amidst turbulent waters, with a character (likely a member of the Whitebeard pirates) falling into the sea.  The overall tone is one of urgency and alarm.
