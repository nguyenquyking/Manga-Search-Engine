One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene. Momonosuke is lying injured on the ground, bleeding. A large, flaming skull-shaped creature is present, possibly an enemy.  Another character, potentially an ally, expresses concern ("I can hear it!!").  The scene is chaotic with onomatopoeia indicating explosions and roars.  The overall tone is dramatic and violent.
