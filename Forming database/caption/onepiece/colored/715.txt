This One Piece SBS Question Corner features Eiichiro Oda, the creator, responding to fan questions.  The first question concerns Oda's habit of wearing breast bands as a disguise, which Oda humorously deflects.  The second question addresses a perceived inconsistency in Sanji's character regarding his refusal to hit women, referencing a scene from Volume 87 where Sanji appears to kick Big Mom. Oda clarifies that Sanji was deflecting Big Mom's punch to protect Reiju, not striking her.  The final question and answer involve Sanji's attempt to justify ogling women in a mixed bath, which Oda firmly rebukes.  The image includes panels showing various characters, including Sanji, Big Mom, Luffy, and Reiju, in relevant scenes from the manga.
