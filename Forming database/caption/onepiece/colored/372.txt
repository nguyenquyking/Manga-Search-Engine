One Piece manga panel depicting a scene on a beach where three creatures—a lion-like monster dog, a cat-like creature, and a river imp—are tied to stakes and about to be burned.  Several villagers, including a boy in a kimono, watch. One of the bound creatures, identifying itself as a Kappa, expresses distress.  A separate panel shows a boat at sea with people expressing surprise at the number of islands.  The overall tone is one of panic and impending violence.
