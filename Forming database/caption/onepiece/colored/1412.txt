One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a large, smiling woman with purple hair (likely Charlotte Smoothie) and a man with red hair lying injured.  The next shows a group of people fleeing a large, angry man, possibly representing the arrival of the Pelican Eel.  Following panels show a man with scarred face lamenting his sister Brulee's injury, who is shown badly hurt and crying.  The dialogue reveals the man's revenge on Katakuri and Smoothie's role in a plan.  The overall scene is tense, focusing on the aftermath of a conflict and the emotional distress caused.
