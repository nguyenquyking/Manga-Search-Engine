One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between Luffy and a large, horned, dark-haired character (likely Shuron Hakke).  Luffy, appearing slightly intoxicated, is taunted by the larger opponent who laughs uproariously. The larger character uses an attack called "Shuron Hakke," and Luffy acknowledges the opponent's strength while seemingly unfazed by the attack.  The scene is dynamic, filled with motion lines and impactful speech bubbles.
