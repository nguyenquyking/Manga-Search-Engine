One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy and his crew encountering several figures in Wano Country.  Luffy, appearing shirtless and muscular, is central. He is surrounded by Kawamatsu (a large sumo wrestler), a female figure wearing a yellow kimono and oni mask (Kikunojo of the Fallen Snow), a kappa, and Raizo of the Mist (a ninja).  Other characters express surprise and concern. The scene suggests a critical moment in gaining the trust of these powerful figures.  Hyogoro, previously mentioned, is also shown in a smaller panel.  The overall tone is one of tension and revelation.
