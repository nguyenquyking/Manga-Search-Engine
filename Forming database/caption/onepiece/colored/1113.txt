One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in the Flower Capital.  A teacher explains to students the concept of a closed nation, contrasting it with an open nation. The teacher emphasizes the importance of closing borders to protect national peace, citing past attempts to open Wano as foolish and harmful.  The panel also shows Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards, and a woman in a kimono who appears to be explaining the dangers of allowing outside influence into Wano.  The visual style is characteristic of the One Piece manga, with exaggerated expressions and vibrant colors.  The setting is clearly Wano Country, with traditional Japanese architecture visible.
