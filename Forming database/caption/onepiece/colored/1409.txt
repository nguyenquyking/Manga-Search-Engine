Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga panel suitable for vector embedding:  **Panel depicts a poignant farewell scene.**  Sanji, in a hooded cloak, is shown extinguishing a cigarette.  A woman, likely Nami, is seen crying, embracing a man who appears to be a departing crew member, possibly with altered vision (three eyes).  The overall mood is melancholic, emphasizing the emotion of goodbye.  The style mimics a film reel with individual frames.
