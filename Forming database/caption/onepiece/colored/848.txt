One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among the Big Mom Pirates.  Katakuri argues with Perospero about succession, emphasizing power over seniority.  Perospero, in his flamboyant attire, disagrees, suggesting the Big Mom Pirates will become the Perospero Pirates.  A third character, possibly a female member, expresses confidence in Big Mom's survival despite being washed ashore in enemy territory (possibly Kaido's). The scene shows Big Mom's ship, a whimsical confectionery-themed vessel, sailing on the sea.  The final panel shows other pirates reacting to the situation.
