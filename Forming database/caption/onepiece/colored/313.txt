One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with Nico Robin and several other characters.  The top panel shows a burning banquet hall (third floor) with Robin seemingly under some influence.  The second panel shows Robin being urged by others to ignore a mysterious voice. The bottom panels feature Professor Clover, who exclaims "It's been so long, my dear!", a woman (likely Robin's mother) saying "Come here, Robin!", and another woman looking on with an expression of surprise.  The overall scene is chaotic and suggests a reunion with emotional weight.
