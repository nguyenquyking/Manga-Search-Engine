One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Kaido, in his dragon form, unleashes a powerful "Bagua" attack, a purple energy blast, striking an opponent.  Another panel shows the impact causing significant damage and injury.  A character, possibly Zoro, is shown severely wounded, pleading for strength.  The overall scene is violent and displays the destructive power of Kaido's attack and the dire situation of the injured character.  The style is dynamic and action-packed, with onomatopoeia and visual effects emphasizing the intensity of the combat.
