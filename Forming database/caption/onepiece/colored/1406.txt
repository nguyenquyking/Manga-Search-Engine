One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  The first panel shows Nami crying, distressed by a sweet substance, while Sanji smokes a cigarette nearby, seemingly unfazed. The second panel showcases a chaotic naval battle, featuring a large, candy-themed ship and numerous smaller vessels.  The final panel shows a large, monstrous character (likely a boss or antagonist) in the midst of the battle, urging his crew to hold fast, as Luffy's crew is about to leave the area, ending the conflict. The text boxes emphasize the emotional turmoil, the ensuing battle, and the final resolution of the conflict.
