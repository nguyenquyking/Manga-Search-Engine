One Piece manga page featuring a sequence of four illustrated steps depicting a specific action, possibly a martial art move or dance.  The text labels these steps as "left up," "right down," "spin," and "soy!!" (likely a sound effect).  The author, Eiichiro Oda, is credited.  A smaller section shows Nami and Chopper from One Piece, and an advertisement for official YouTube and LINE channels with QR codes and Monkey D. Luffy's image is also present.  The overall context suggests promotional material accompanying a One Piece volume release.
