One Piece manga panel depicting Hiyori, the younger sister of Kozuki Momonosuke, revealing her identity.  She's in a traditional Wano kimono, speaking to an unseen individual who suspects her brother's presence in Wano. The scene shows a snowy Wano village and a man (possibly a samurai) drinking tea,  implied to be involved in the secret surrounding Momonosuke's return after 20 years of separation.  The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga.
