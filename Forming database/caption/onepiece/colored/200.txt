One Piece manga panel depicting a tense confrontation. Luffy, visibly angry, shouts "Yamabro!!" at an unseen opponent.  Yamato, in the lower panel, is seen riding Momo, a dragon, while addressing Momonosuke.  A woman with white hair, likely Ulti, is shown injured and reacting to an attack, while another character, possibly Kawamatsu, is supporting Momo.  The scene is filled with action lines and speech bubbles indicating conflict and urgency.  The dialogue focuses on Luffy's frustration, Yamato's attempt to control Momo, and support for Momonosuke.
