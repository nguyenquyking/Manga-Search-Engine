One Piece manga panel depicting:  A flashback six years after a significant event, 33 years before the present.  The remnants of the Rocks Pirates are gathering new comrades.  The scene shows Lord Oden's castle in the background, with a focus on Kuri Beach, Wano.  In the foreground, several monstrous, hairy creatures are on the beach near a wrecked ship. A character, possibly a Mink, is shown reacting with surprise ("They are unsettling!!"). Text boxes indicate confusion about the creatures' nature ("Monstrous creatures?!", "Hairy humans?!", "What are these? Animals?!").
