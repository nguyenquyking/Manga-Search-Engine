One Piece SBS Question Corner featuring several panels.  The top panel shows a drawing of Doflamingo, resembling Spider-Man, prompting a question about the visual similarity. Another panel shows a flashback from chapter 943, volume 94, depicting characters eating Smile fruits and describing them as "good apples," leading to a question about their taste. A final panel shows Nami, prompting a question about pulling her kimono sash.  The responses address the visual comparison to Spider-Man, explain the deception regarding Smile fruit taste, and humorously decline the request concerning Nami's kimono.
