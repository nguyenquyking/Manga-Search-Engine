One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A large beast has destroyed a portion of the capital, swallowing a full-sized town.  Miraculously, there were no fatalities.  A blond man, possibly Oden, is seen embracing a distraught woman, while others react with shock and awe.  Another scene shows a man lying on the ground, seemingly injured or unconscious, as another figure walks away.  The final panel shows the blond man, possibly Oden, addressing a crowd, about to reveal what happened.  The overall tone suggests a significant event with both devastation and relief.
