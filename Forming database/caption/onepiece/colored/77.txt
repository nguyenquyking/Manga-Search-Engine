One Piece manga scene depicting a large-scale battle.  Yamato, with her characteristic white hair and oni horns, is shown reacting to an explosion.  Another panel shows a sword fight, possibly between  a samurai and another character (unidentifiable). A large, enraged, purple creature’s face is partially visible in another panel. Finally, a powerful dragon-like creature unleashes a fiery blast, creating significant destruction.  The scene is filled with onomatopoeia depicting explosions and fighting sounds.  The overall tone suggests intense, destructive conflict.
