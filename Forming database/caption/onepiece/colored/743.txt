One Piece manga panel depicting Luffy, significantly larger than before, with two other sumo wrestlers.  Luffy is asked if he got fatter overnight.  A discussion ensues about whether to announce that all of his *oshiruko* (sweet red bean soup) vanished overnight.  Another scene shows two characters reacting to the news via a visual transponder snail, concerned about Luffy's reaction to the news.  A third scene shows a crowd watching, with a character commenting on Luffy's survival.  The overall scene is comedic and focuses on Luffy's unexpected weight gain and its consequences.
