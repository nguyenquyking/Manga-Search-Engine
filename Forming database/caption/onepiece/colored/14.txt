One Piece manga scene depicting a dramatic moment.  Lord Momonosuke, deeply distraught, pleads with his mother (likely Toki) to come with him and Hiyori.  He acknowledges the weight of the decision and the shame involved.  Other samurai,  visibly emotional, express their willingness to die as samurai if necessary. The scene is intense, with flames and a sense of impending doom.  The dialogue emphasizes the weight of responsibility on Momonosuke despite his youth.
