One Piece manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  The top panel shows a city in shock, reacting to news ("Whaaaat?!").  Subsequent panels show a discussion between Kurozumi Orochi (large, pink-haired man), other Daimyo, and Lord Yasue (stern-faced man with a bandana).  Orochi is accused of stealing the Shogun's throne through deceit, prompting a heated response.  Inukai (dog-like character with sunglasses) is also present, seemingly supporting Orochi.  The overall scene is one of political intrigue and conflict following Oden's death.
