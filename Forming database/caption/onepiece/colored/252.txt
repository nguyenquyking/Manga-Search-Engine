One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A large, dark-haired man offers a bowl of rice to a seated, smaller figure whose hands are bound. The smaller figure is surprised and seems reluctant to eat.  In another panel, a small, white-haired character, possibly a child, is ravenously eating rice.  A larger, similarly styled character observes, commenting on the smaller character's surprising appetite and the surprising eating habits of samurai. The overall scene contrasts the expected stoicism of samurai with a child's voracious hunger.  The setting appears to be a dark, possibly underground location.
