One Piece manga panel depicting the Thousand Sunny sailing through turbulent waters.  A giant octopus is seen in the background, and a school of Koi fish surrounds the ship.  Luffy and Chopper react with surprise.  Nami and Brook are shown in a separate panel discussing the difficult weather conditions and the closed nation.  The scene is filled with onomatopoeia representing the sounds of the ocean and the fish.
