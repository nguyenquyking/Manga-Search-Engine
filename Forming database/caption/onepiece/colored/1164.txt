A One Piece manga panel depicting a fight between Luffy and a large, muscular sumo wrestler named Urashima.  Urashima, with pink hair, is repeatedly attempting powerful slaps, labeled "Bodhi-Sattva Slap," while Luffy, agilely dodging each blow. Other onlookers, including other sumo wrestlers, observe the fight.  Speech bubbles indicate Luffy's attempts to avoid defeat by running, and others comment on Luffy's evasion skills and the unorthodox nature of the fight.  The final panel shows Luffy narrowly avoiding a devastating blow, with sound effects indicating the force of the near miss. The scene is set in what appears to be a sumo wrestling ring or similar arena.
