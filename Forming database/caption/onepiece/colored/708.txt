The panel shows two groups: the "Pleasures," who were left with eternal laughter, and the "Gifters," who successfully gained animal strength.  The text explains that the Smile fruit's name mocks the unfortunate condition of those who didn't gain animal powers.  Two prominent figures are shown, likely leaders or representatives of these groups, showcasing their contrasting fates.  The visual style is consistent with One Piece's manga art.
