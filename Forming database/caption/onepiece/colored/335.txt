One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, blue-skinned, horned figure (likely a member of the Tobi Roppo) is heavily wounded, his body showing significant injuries. He's speaking to a dark-haired man in a dark suit who is lying on the ground after an apparent attack. The injured figure comments on the opponent's attack and his own remaining wound.  The background shows a desolate, rocky landscape.  The dialogue boxes reveal the injured figure's frustration and the other's dismissive response.  The color of the Supreme King is mentioned.
