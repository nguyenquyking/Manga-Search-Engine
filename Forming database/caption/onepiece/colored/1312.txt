One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  Bartholomew Kuma, large and cyborg-like, is central.  A blond man, likely Sanji, expresses determination alongside another character whose face is mostly obscured.  A cat-like character with goggles speaks about the Celestial Dragons and the risks of their plan.  The scene highlights a desperate attempt to free Kuma, who has been a victim of the World Government.  The visual style is characteristic of One Piece manga, with dramatic expressions and action lines.
