One Piece manga scene depicting a chaotic battle in an amusement park.  A large cake-like structure is prominently featured.  The main antagonists, including a character resembling a scarecrow in striped clothing, and other figures with dark clothing, are unleashing attacks.  Other characters are shown reacting to or involved in the attack, resulting in a large explosion of white "flavor".  The scene is highly dynamic with motion lines and onomatopoeia suggesting powerful blows and explosions. The text suggests this event is a "flavor bomb" and a "ceremony".
