One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  A blond-haired man, possibly Boar, lies bleeding profusely on the ground, amidst burning debris and a large boar-like creature.  He expresses a desire to die alongside Tsuru, who is shown in a separate panel seemingly unharmed but concerned. The overall scene is one of destruction and intense emotional conflict, with the central focus on Boar's fatal injury and his connection to Tsuru.
