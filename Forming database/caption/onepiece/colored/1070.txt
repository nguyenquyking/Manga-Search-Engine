One Piece manga panel depicting a planning meeting for a rebellion in Wano.  A character, possibly a leader, displays a symbol – two birds on fire above a pit viper and a reversed crescent moon – signifying the rebellion's meeting time and place (Habu Port, during the Fire Festival's twilight second hour). Another character explains that the symbol will be distributed to those with a moon mark on their left foot.  Zoro and Usohachi are noted as being engaged in a separate mission in the capital.  Other Straw Hats, including Nami and Chopper, are present, observing the planning. The overall scene emphasizes the strategic preparations and coordination for the upcoming rebellion.
