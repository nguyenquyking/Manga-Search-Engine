One Piece manga panel depicting a large city under a giant tree, with smaller panels showing character interactions.  A character, possibly Yasue, is being confronted by several others.  One character, an older man with a large, exaggerated grin and blue hair, confesses to creating a circulating riddle image.  The scene conveys anger, tension, and a revelation related to the Kozuki clan's death and the lack of manpower to avenge them over the past 20 years.  The image's visual style is consistent with One Piece's artistic design.
