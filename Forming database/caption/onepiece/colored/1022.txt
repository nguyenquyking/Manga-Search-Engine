One Piece manga panel depicting Kaido, in his dragon form, observing the aftermath of a battle.  A defeated Trafalgar Law lies bleeding on the ground.  Kaido comments on Law's strength and the presence of other powerful individuals ("Supreme Kings").  A large, pink-haired character (likely a subordinate or ally to Kaido) is shown in a separate panel, reacting to events.  The scene showcases Kaido's immense power and his dismissive attitude toward his opponents.  The overall tone is one of dominance and impending further conflict.
