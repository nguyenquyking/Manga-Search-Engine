One Piece SBS corner featuring Fire Atacchan, a famous cameraman now working for the World Economic Journal.  The image shows panels of Fire Atacchan, initially with a cap on his camera lens, then without, taking photographs.  A question asks about Luffy using his hat to cover Katakuri's mouth, prompting a humorous response from Oda about covering a naked sleeping Oda.  Additional panels depict various scenes related to the discussion.
