One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with two animal characters, Hihimaru (a white monkey-like creature wielding a katana) and Komachiyo (a large, golden lion-dog).  Hihimaru is shown leaving, stating he's gone and will become a kunoichi. Komachiyo expresses approval of a person (implied to be Luffy, though unseen) and their strength.  The scene also includes dialogue referencing a ship and hiding from bad guys.  The overall tone is friendly and adventurous.
