One Piece manga panel depicting Yamato and Momonosuke.  Yamato, surprised, asks if Momonosuke is alright.  A previous panel shows a female character (likely a Straw Hat) encasing enemies in ice after a massive explosion that blew the bottom off an island.  Another panel shows Zunesha, the elephant from Oden's journal, is nearby.  The final panel reveals Zunesha, a companion of Joyboy,  who committed a crime 800 years ago.
