One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with three characters.  Okiiku, a teahouse waitress, is politely refusing food from a large, boastful sumo wrestler, Urashima, who is known as the greatest sumo wrestler in Wano. A smaller female figure, possibly another waitress, stands near Urashima's teahouse.  Okiiku is wearing a yellow kimono, and Urashima is wearing a green kimono. The scene is set outside a teahouse in Wano.  The dialogue indicates a class difference between the characters.
