One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Trafalgar Law and Eustass Kid are on the verge of defeat, as indicated by the text "They're both on death's door!!!".  Several other characters are shown attacking them, taking advantage of their weakened state.  Shanks is seen issuing commands to protect Law and Kid, while other characters like Big Mom (briefly shown), and possibly Kaido (implied) are also present, though not clearly visible in the main action. The overall tone is one of intense combat and a shift in power dynamics.  The visual style emphasizes dynamic action lines and energy effects.
