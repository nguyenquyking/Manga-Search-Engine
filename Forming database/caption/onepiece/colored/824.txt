One Piece manga panel depicting a raid.  A group, including Nami and a large, blonde man (possibly an antagonist), are reacting to a situation.  The blonde man orders everyone to line up and show their feet.  Another scene shows a bathhouse raid where people are being arrested if they have a waning crescent moon marking on their ankle.  Nami and another woman (Shinobu) are concerned about a leaked plan.  The overall scene is tense and suggests a betrayal or compromised operation.
