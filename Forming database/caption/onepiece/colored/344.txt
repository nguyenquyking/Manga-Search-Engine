One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters, including Oden and Whitebeard.  Oden, with long blonde hair and a large hat, is seated, declaring his intent to leave Wano despite the strict laws against it. Whitebeard, in the background, agrees to let him go.  Another character, a Daimyo, expresses surprise at the vast number of islands in the world.  Two weeks later, Oden's ship is shown sailing away, with Inu and Neko (possibly, depending on the context) reacting in the foreground.  The scene also features discussions about the Daimyo's travel plans and the sheer number of islands.
