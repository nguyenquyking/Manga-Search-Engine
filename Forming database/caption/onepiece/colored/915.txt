One Piece manga illustration featuring a collage of artwork.  The main focus is a large, detailed image of a green dragon, possibly representing a character or symbolic element within the One Piece universe.  Surrounding the dragon are several One Piece characters:  Usopp, Franky, Chopper, and others (identifiable by their distinct appearances).  These characters appear in a style reminiscent of traditional Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints.  Smaller illustrations at the bottom showcase a fan-created drawing of a character and a dynamic combat scene between Mihawk and Shanks. The text indicates this is an illustration from a contest, with the winning entries shown. The caption mentions "Wano Country Great War" and "Ukiyo-e style," highlighting the artistic theme.
