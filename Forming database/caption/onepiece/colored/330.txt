One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Trafalgar Law is shown using his "Room" ability, launching a powerful attack ("Anti-Bacterial Curtain") that strikes Kaido.  Kaido is reacting to the attack with visible damage and the sound effect "Shot!!!".  Kaido's expression and dialogue ("Hakk!! Ooh...") show pain and surprise.  Law's attack causes a large impact ("Za-Doom!!") and sends Kaido flying backward.  The panel also features sound effects and onomatopoeia associated with the attacks and impact.
