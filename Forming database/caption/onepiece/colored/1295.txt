One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  A large, lion-like character with blond hair is eating cheese.  Another character, appearing to be a man with glasses, observes him along with a woman with blonde hair and a smaller, possibly child-like character.  The conversation centers around a warlord named Weevil, who is claiming to be Whitebeard's son and attacking anyone connected to him. The lion-like character expresses concern that Weevil will come after him. The scene also shows a peaceful village in the background, and a mention of a message to be sent to Cat Viper.  The overall tone is one of anticipation and slight unease.
