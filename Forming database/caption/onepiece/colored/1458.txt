This One Piece manga page features several illustrations and artist submissions.  The top panel shows a stylized image of Carrot in her Sulong form.  Below are illustrations by different artists: one depicts a scene with Zoro, a monkey, and other figures; another shows a character resembling Pedro; and the final panel showcases a dramatic scene with multiple characters in a dark, possibly gothic style.  The text identifies the artists' locations and names, including Carrot’s transformation, and describes the submitted illustrations’ subjects (Zoro, Pedro).
