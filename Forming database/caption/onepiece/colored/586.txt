One Piece manga scene:  Killer, with his mechanical arm, stands defiantly alongside another character (likely Eustass Kid) amidst rubble.  Killer declares, "Let's go, Killer," and "We do things our own way!!!"  The other character is in agreement, wanting to retrieve their people.  In the background, a scene depicting the destruction of an alliance is shown, with dialogue boxes indicating distrust and disdain for alliances.
