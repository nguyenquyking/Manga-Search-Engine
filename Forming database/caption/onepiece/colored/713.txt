One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A powerful figure in ornate clothing, possibly Komurasaki's killer, delivers a monologue about the Komurasaki family's demise.  This figure is shown in the upper panel, wielding a weapon.  The lower panels show the aftermath: a character, possibly Otoko, is crying, while another character, her father, is being attacked.  Other characters react with fear and laughter in the background.  The scene is set in what appears to be a Japanese-style town, with buildings and fences visible.  The overall mood is tense and violent.
