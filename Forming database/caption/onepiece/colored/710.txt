One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in Ebisu Town.  The panel shows a contrast between the town's cheerful outward appearance and its tragic history.  People are seen happily distributing apples, while other panels reveal the townspeople's impoverished state and the underlying sorrow stemming from a past tragedy where children couldn't mourn their parents' deaths.  Zoro is present, observing the scene.  A woman is shown crying, understanding the true nature of the "happy" facade.  The panels show the distribution of apples, highlighting the abundance of fruit and the reactions of various townspeople, including children and adults. The overall narrative suggests a deceptive happiness masking a deeper sadness.
