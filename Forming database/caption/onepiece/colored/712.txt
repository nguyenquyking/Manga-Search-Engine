One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene. Toko, Tonoyasu's daughter, is the focus, with several characters reacting to her presence. Orochi's subordinates are shown violently trying to stop her, while a man with a gun tries to clear a path.  Another character, seemingly a father figure, pleads for Toko's return.  A separate panel shows a character administering medicine to an injured person, possibly as a result of the altercation.  The overall mood is tense and action-packed.
