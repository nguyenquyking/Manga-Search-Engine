One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation. A woman in a red, revealing outfit and a top hat, possibly a pirate captain, stands defiantly, holding a large staff.  She is surrounded by townsfolk armed with sticks, who appear apprehensive.  Two other characters, Lind and Karasu, are shown preparing to support the woman.  The scene is tense, with speech bubbles indicating a challenge and the townspeople's choice to fight or flee.  The woman's confident posture and the townsfolk's armed resistance suggest an impending battle.
