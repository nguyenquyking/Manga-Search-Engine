One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Komurasaki, in a vibrant red and pink kimono, defiantly refuses to apologize to a group of angry men, including a large, shouting man.  She asserts her rightness and rejects groveling.  Another panel shows Komurasaki's past consideration of making her the Shogun's wife. The scene is set in what appears to be a Japanese-inspired setting.  The overall mood is tense and dramatic.
