One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in Flower Capital, Wano.  Sanji,  a cook with black hair and a teal shirt, and a large, muscular man with light blue hair, both enjoy bowls of soba noodles. A woman with dark hair in a kimono observes them, seemingly seeking information about Luffy.  Another character, possibly Zoro, with blonde hair, smiles mischievously. The panel emphasizes the deliciousness of the soba and the characters’ reactions to it, alongside the search for Luffy.
