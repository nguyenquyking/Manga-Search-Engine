One Piece manga panel depicting Shiryu of the Rain, the second ship captain of the Blackbeard Pirates, newly possessing the Clear-Clear Fruit.  He's in his military uniform, reacting to an unseen event.  Shiryu comments on his newfound invisibility power, referencing Gecko Moria's prediction.  Another character, possibly Absalom, is shown in a smaller panel, possibly having been affected by Shiryu's ability. A third character, seemingly surprised, is also shown. The scene is set against a backdrop of a desert-like landscape.
