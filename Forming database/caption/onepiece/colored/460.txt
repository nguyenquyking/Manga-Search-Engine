One Piece manga panel depicting a discussion among a group of people, possibly military strategists, about the alliance between two Emperors.  The panel shows a large, fortified building in the background. The discussion centers on the Rocks Pirates, a legendary crew known for internal conflict.  A key point is the unexpected alliance of Big Mom and Kaido, two historically rivalrous Emperors, and the lack of information about the Rocks' goals.  The scene highlights the significant challenge this alliance poses.
