One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A large, sumo-like figure is being lifted into the air in a palanquin within a Japanese-style town.  People in the crowd express shock and fear, with speech bubbles indicating "You betrayed me!", "Okikuuu!!!", "He's got the face of some demon god!!", "How frightful!!", and "What has this one done...? In front of so many people!!".  A woman with dark hair and a yellow top reacts with horror, exclaiming "Oh no!!". The overall scene suggests betrayal and a supernatural element.
