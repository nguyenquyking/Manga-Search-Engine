One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a village landscape, possibly Amigasa Village in Kuri, with characters discussing a journey to Udon.  The second panel features Kin'emon, Momonosuke (in his dragon form), and another character, possibly a woman, discussing safety and the journey. A masked figure is also present.  The third panel shows Otama crying, seemingly distraught, while a woman, possibly O-Kiku, comforts her.  The dialogue reveals concern for Momonosuke's safety, Otama's return, and a discussion about a female ninja's (Kunoichi's) inexperience.  The overall scene suggests a journey to Udon and possible danger.
