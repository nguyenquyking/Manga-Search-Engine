A colored manga panel depicting a battle scene from One Piece.  Zoro is paralyzed by a ghostly, scythe-wielding figure emanating a green energy.  He struggles, saying "Stop... get away from me!" and "It won't move!".  The figure is large and imposing, its scythe creating a swirling green vortex. Another panel shows Franky yelling "Outta the way!!" as he is seemingly attacked by an explosion.  A map shows Zoro's and Franky's positions within a dome structure.  In the first panel, a distressed Luffy asks "Who the hell are you?" and in another, he pleads "Zoro... please don't die on us!!".  The scene is dynamic and intense, highlighting a perilous situation for Zoro.
