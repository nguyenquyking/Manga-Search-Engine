One Piece manga panel depicting a Marine Headquarters meeting concerning the redrawing of pirate bounties.  A high-ranking Marine officer, possibly Sengoku, addresses a group of Marines regarding the dissolution of the Seven Warlords system and the need to update bounties, particularly for the Four Emperors, including Blackbeard, Kaido and Big Mom, who were previously allies. The panel shows a large group of marines and a goat.  The visual element of a large snail-shaped bounty board is present. The discussion highlights the formation of a powerful new pirate alliance.
