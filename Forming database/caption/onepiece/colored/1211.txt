One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A long-haired blonde man with a cross tattoo, likely a Straw Hat, explains his "Straw-Straw" power, allowing him to infuse his body with subordinates' spirits for enhanced resilience.  He's facing off against a towering, skeletal figure with long white hair and purple robes, possibly a member of the Worst Generation.  The scene shows several Straw Hats, including Zoro,  facing the skeletal figure.  A large, lion-like creature is also present, carrying another character.  The overall mood is tense and suggests a game or battle is about to begin.
