This One Piece manga SBS (special bonus section) features two questions and answers.  The first question asks about a scene from *One Piece Film Gold*, where Sakazuki calls Rob Lucci "Mr. Pervert." The answer explains that Lucci was printing inappropriate pictures, hence the comment.  An illustration shows Lucci seemingly creating these pictures. The second question concerns the cylindrical snails in Wano Country, which resemble Transponder Snails. The answer, referencing Usopp from chapter 934, explains that they are river snails transmitting mental signals and became common after Kin'emon's group vanished.  Illustrations include a Marine Captain (likely Sakazuki), a panel from the *One Piece Film Gold* scene, and a close-up of a Wano snail alongside a description.
