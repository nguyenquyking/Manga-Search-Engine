One Piece manga panel depicting a strategic discussion.  The World Government plans to annex Wano. A go board shows the current (12,000 vs 8,000) and pre-battle (30,000 vs 5,400) forces of Kaido and the Samurai.  A separate scene shows characters reacting to a new order concerning the Straw Hat Crew.  The overall tone is one of serious strategic planning and disbelief at the possibility of the Straw Hats defeating Kaido.
