One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Zoro, using his three-sword style, launches a powerful "Arrow" attack, which is described as "Thunderous."  The attack creates a massive purple and white energy blast.  An opponent (possibly Kaido) is shown reacting to the impact.  The final panel shows a close-up of the impact, with Zoro's attack hitting its target.  The visual style emphasizes explosive energy and dynamic motion lines.
