One Piece manga scene depicting a massive, fiery, dragon-like creature, the "Flaming Drum Dragon," emerging from a dark purple sky.  A smaller character, seemingly female, with white hair, is shown using a long staff, possibly attempting to attack or interact with the dragon.  Speech bubbles indicate the dragon's long wait for intervention and the smaller character's plan to vaporize a part of the dragon.  The overall scene is dramatic, with intense colors and action lines.
