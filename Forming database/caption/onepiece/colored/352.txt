One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene on a beach.  A large, obese man in orange robes (possibly an enemy) is wielding a sword, causing several fleeing characters to shout in fear.  One woman with teal hair witnesses this, while another woman with teal hair and pink clothing expresses shock and concern. A large ship is shown sailing away in the background.  Speech bubbles indicate fear, pleading for help, and regret over the situation.  The text mentions "Lord Oden" and an "Umbozou Sea Monster," suggesting a significant event. The overall tone is one of urgency and impending danger.
