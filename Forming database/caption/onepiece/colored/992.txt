One Piece manga panel depicting Nami and Shinobu. Shinobu, a large woman in pink ninja attire, uses a large kite (Ninpo: Great Kite) to carry a smaller Nami through the air above a Japanese-style town.  Nami, in a blue and white outfit, appears to be assisting in the kite's navigation.  Text bubbles indicate they are pursuing an intruder and a cat, and Nami successfully learned the shipment's details. The scene showcases Shinobu's impressive ninpo skills.
