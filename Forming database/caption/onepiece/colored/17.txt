One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  Kaido, wielding a kanabo, clashes with an opponent (likely Luffy, though his face is not fully visible), resulting in a massive explosion labeled "KABOOM!!".  Kaido is shown saying, "Play all the games you want..." while his opponent reacts with "GWAAA!!!" and "BAKONN!!".  The scene is dynamic, with motion lines and onomatopoeia emphasizing the intensity of the fight.  The style is reminiscent of colored manga panels.
