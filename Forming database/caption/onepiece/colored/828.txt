Text indicates Bepo and his friends have been captured, and the escape is to avoid the city plunging into chaos.  The escapees learned about ankle tattoos, which the pursuers intend to use to lure out Traffy.  The scene shows a cityscape with Asian-inspired architecture.  The overall tone is urgent and dangerous.
