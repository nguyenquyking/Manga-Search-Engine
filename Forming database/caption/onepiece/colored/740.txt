One Piece manga panel depicting several characters and scenes.  A large, monstrous figure resembling a dragon is shown, possibly representing a destroyed structure.  Kyoshiro, wearing sunglasses and a purple robe, expresses approval.  Another panel shows a large, shocked, dark-skinned man with purple hair, possibly in disbelief.  A background panel shows a damaged Japanese-style castle under a cherry blossom tree.  The text indicates that someone is imprisoned in the Rasetsu Prisoners' Quarters, but their unexpected emergence is considered more significant. The main focus is on the surprise and disbelief at this character's survival.
