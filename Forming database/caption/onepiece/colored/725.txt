One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation. Orochi, a large, grotesque figure with blue hair, is threatened by Yasue, another large figure with purple hair, who holds a pistol.  Yasue is about to shoot Orochi. In the background, a procession approaches, indicating the arrival of the shogun in Rasetsu Town.  Another panel shows a crucified figure, possibly representing Oden, with text indicating his legacy and Orochi's perceived weakness.  The overall scene is one of intense conflict and impending doom.
