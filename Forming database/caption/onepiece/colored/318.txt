One Piece manga scene depicting a confrontation.  Yamato, with blonde hair, is shown in two panels; first, seemingly attacked by an illusion or shadow,  and then later upside down within a fiery, circular inferno, possibly a dream.  Another female character, possibly Robin, observes with a concerned expression in the first panel.  Text bubbles indicate Yamato's disbelief ("What was that?") and the other character's questioning of Yamato's state ("How can you say that, when you're clearly dreaming?").  The second panel shows Yamato dreaming of defeating Kaido, represented by fiery Oni masks.  Brook's shadow is briefly visible in the upper panel.
