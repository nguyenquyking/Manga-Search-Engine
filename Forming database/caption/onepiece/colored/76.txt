One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A female samurai, likely Yamato, vehemently argues against surrender, emphasizing the samurai spirit and the sacrifices already made by Wano's daimyo over the past 20 years fighting Orochi.  She is shown in close-up, expressing determination despite the dire situation.  The panel also includes a depiction of Kaido's dragon form, wounded but still threatening. The dialogue highlights the emotional weight of the battle and the samurai's refusal to give up, even in the face of overwhelming odds and Luffy's potential defeat.
