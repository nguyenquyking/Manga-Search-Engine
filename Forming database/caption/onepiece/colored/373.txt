One Piece manga scene depicting Oden, a muscular man in a loincloth, confronting a group of individuals who are torturing children.  Oden is holding a sword and has just struck down some of his attackers.  The attackers, a collection of anthropomorphic animals and humans, are shown either cowering in fear or lying injured on the beach.  One panel shows Oden catching a large fish, likely for a stew.  Text bubbles indicate Oden's anger and disgust at the cruelty inflicted upon the children. The overall scene is set on a beach with a background of water and islands.
