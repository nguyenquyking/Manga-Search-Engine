One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  Komurasaki is surrounded by multiple Komurasaki-themed dragon statues.  She confronts an unseen assailant, defiantly stating she is a samurai's daughter and will not disgrace herself.  Other characters, including a man in a dark kimono and a woman in a pink kimono, are present, seemingly observing or reacting to the situation.  The overall scene suggests a confrontation within a palace or shogun's residence.  The word "Bedlam" is used to describe the scene.
