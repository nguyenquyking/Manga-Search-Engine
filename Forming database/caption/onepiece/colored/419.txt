This One Piece manga panel depicts the story of Lord Oden.  The first panel shows a young Oden engaging in a violent confrontation with the Yakuza, setting their building on fire.  Subsequent panels detail his arrest, imprisonment in a quarry where he excelled as a stonemason, and subsequent attempts to alleviate a drought by redirecting a river, leading to further arrest.  The final panel contrasts Oden's actions as a young man with his later reformed self.  Key characters shown are Lord Oden at different ages and possibly a prison warden.  Visual elements include depictions of violence, a river, a quarry, and a drought-stricken capital.
