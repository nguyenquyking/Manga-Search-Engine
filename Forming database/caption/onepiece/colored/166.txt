One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes and characters reacting to a significant event.  The top panel shows a burning castle with a cloaked figure.  Text indicates the All-Stars have been defeated and Nico Robin's capture is discussed. Below, various characters react:  Law (Trafalgar Law), Chopper (Tony Tony Chopper), Luffy (Monkey D. Luffy), and others, including a large, laughing figure (possibly a member of the Revolutionary Army).  The overall tone suggests a climactic moment with the fate of an era hanging in the balance.  The text emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the low probability of a new generation winning.
