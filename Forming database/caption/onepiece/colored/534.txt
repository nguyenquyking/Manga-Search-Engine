One Piece manga panel depicting a conflict between two characters.  A green frog-like creature with orange hair, possibly a member of the Kappa, is being attacked by a small, white fox-like creature with bandages. The fox is biting the frog's hand.  Text bubbles indicate dialogue about a future war and the fox's frustration at the situation.  A subsequent panel shows the frog-like creature biting another character, possibly a samurai, referencing the coming resurgence of the samurai.  The overall scene is violent and dramatic, hinting at a larger conflict.
