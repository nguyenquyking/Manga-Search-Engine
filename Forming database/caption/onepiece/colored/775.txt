One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between a young woman with teal hair (possibly Hiyori) and Roronoa Zoro.  Hiyori expresses happiness and mentions being the daughter of a samurai. Zoro discusses the Nine Red Scabbards, specifically mentioning six known members: Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, Okiiku, Dogstorm, and Cat Viper.  Three unnamed Scabbards remain unaccounted for.  The scene shows a snowy Wano landscape with a building in the background.  Hiyori holds a card displaying a symbol, which seems to be causing unrest in the capital.  The panel also includes a younger female character laughing.
