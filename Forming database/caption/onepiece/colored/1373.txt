One Piece manga panel depicting four Revolutionary Army captains: Karasu (North), Lindbergh (South), Belo Betty (East), and Morley (West).  They are introduced as "Military Captains," with emphasis on their presence in one town.  A separate panel shows a masked man snapping for an unknown reason, while another shows a larger, unnamed Revolutionary Army officer expressing disgust at the violence of his subordinates and a discussion about their presence in the town.  The overall scene suggests a tense situation within the Revolutionary Army.
