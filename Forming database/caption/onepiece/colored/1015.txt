One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes and characters.  Scene 1: Raizo (white-haired, in a white coat) sits with Chopper (reindeer-like character in a straw hat) and a purple-haired female character.  They discuss Luffy's condition. Scene 2: Momonosuke (pink-haired, large character) argues with Kikunojo (female character with dark hair).  Ashura Doji (man with lion-like features) is also present with other samurai at Head Mountain. Scene 3: Momonosuke and a smaller, dark-skinned character (possibly Kin'emon) argue, while a blonde female character (possibly Tama) explains her loyalty to Oden.  The final panel shows Head Mountain, a significant location.  The dialogue focuses on Luffy's well-being and the samurai's loyalty.
