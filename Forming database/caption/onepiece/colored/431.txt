One Piece manga scene depicting several characters in samurai-inspired attire.  Luffy, wearing a red and gold samurai armor with large antlers, prepares to attack.  Alongside him stands another samurai, possibly a member of his crew.  A smaller samurai, possibly Chopper, also appears.  Zoro, with his signature green hair and swords, observes from a distance, along with Nami, who is wearing a striped kimono.  The scene suggests an imminent battle, with Luffy's declaration to "slice him in two" and Nami's questioning of their actions. The visual style is consistent with One Piece's dynamic and expressive art.  Speech bubbles convey the characters' thoughts and dialogue.  The background shows a rocky shoreline.
