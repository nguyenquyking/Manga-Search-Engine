Other characters are shown practicing manners, studying books on etiquette, samurai economy, history, and religion, and participating in a formal meal.  The scene highlights the contrast between the ruffians' initial unrefined behavior and their attempts to adopt a more refined samurai culture.  Specific character names are not explicitly provided in the image itself beyond a possible reference to "Lord Oden."
