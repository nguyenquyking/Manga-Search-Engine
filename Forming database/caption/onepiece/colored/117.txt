One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Eustass Kid, enraged, confronts another character (likely Luffy, though not explicitly named) about a recent attack, accusing him of stealing the spotlight.  Other panels show Big Mom's forces reacting to the ongoing fight, with some celebrating and others expressing concern.  The scene is dynamic, filled with shouts and exaggerated expressions, focusing on the rivalry and tension between Kid and the other character.  There's a clear visual indication of a powerful attack, accompanied by flames.
