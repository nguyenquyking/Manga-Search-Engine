One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  In the first panel, a large procession of prisoners and guards, including a large, muscular prisoner on horseback, moves through a gate.  Luffy, small in stature compared to the other prisoners, is shown in subsequent panels. He seemingly intimidates his jailers with a glare, causing one to be visibly scared and another to be injured by a fish-like projectile.  The text emphasizes Luffy's unexpected power, contrasting his size with his ability to subdue his captors with a single look.  The scene highlights the contrast between Luffy's seemingly small size and his overwhelming power.
