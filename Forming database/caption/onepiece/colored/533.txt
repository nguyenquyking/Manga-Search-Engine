One Piece manga panel depicting a snowy scene.  A tanuki-like creature with pink fur and a bandage is seen initially calmly, then later yelling "YIIIP". A small, green, orange-haired character resembling a warrior wearing a straw hat apologizes repeatedly ("Forgive me!") while surrounded by numerous swords stuck in the snow.  The warrior appears to be collecting or arranging the swords. The background shows a snow-covered shrine or temple. The overall action suggests a humorous interaction between the tanuki and the warrior amid a snowy setting.
