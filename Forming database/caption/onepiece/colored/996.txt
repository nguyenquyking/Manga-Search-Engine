One Piece manga panel depicting frantic activity involving the transportation of numerous stone blocks.  Two characters, likely Luffy and a red-haired crewmate (possibly Shanks, but needs further context for confirmation), are shown with exaggerated expressions of exertion, shouting "Graaah!!"  Other panels show workers struggling to move the stones,  with dialogue indicating they've moved around 500 stones and are nearing their capacity. A question about the prisoners' strength while wearing Seastone cuffs is posed, implying the prisoners were exceptionally strong despite the cuffs. The scene is chaotic, emphasizing the physical strain of the task.  The overall context suggests a large-scale construction or transportation project.
