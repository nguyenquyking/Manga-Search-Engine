One Piece manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Top panel shows a character, possibly a warden, expressing concern about communication failure in Udon prison.  A second character, seemingly a prisoner, is declared a winner of an unspecified competition.  The middle panel shows a conversation between two characters, one seemingly Raizo, plotting to steal keys, and another,  likely a prison guard, agreeing to help in exchange for signal disruption.  The bottom panel shows Kawamatsu, possibly held captive, being addressed by another unseen character in Building B of Udon prison.  The communication system is malfunctioning.
