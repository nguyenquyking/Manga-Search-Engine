A large, pink dragon-like creature wreaks havoc on a building's second floor in a One Piece manga panel.  The creature's destructive actions are shown causing significant damage and debris.  Luffy is visibly shocked and yells at Momonosuke ("Knock it off, Momo!! What do you think you're doing?!"), who appears to be the one controlling the creature.  Another character is shown in fear, asking "Where are we?". The scene is filled with onomatopoeia indicating destruction and chaos.
