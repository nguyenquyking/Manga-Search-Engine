One Piece manga SBS section featuring Nami and Robin at ages 40 and 60.  Luffy and Chopper are shown crying over a plate of food in a smaller panel at the top.  Different future versions of Nami are depicted, showing her at age 40 (confident, stylish) and age 60 (older, selling magic vases).  The section also addresses a reader question about Sanji's beard, showing before-and-after images illustrating a shaved prong. Oda apologizes for Sanji's altered beard.
