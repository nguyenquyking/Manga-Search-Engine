One Piece manga panel depicting a scene of violence and desperation.  Large, imposing figures are violently subduing townspeople, with one character shouting "KILL ANY WHO RESIST!!!" Another character pleads, "PLEASE STOP... THIS IS A POOR TOWN! WE HAVE NOTHING!!"  A smaller panel shows a distraught woman explaining the town's plight and the need to pay tribute to the Celestial Dragons. Another scene shows a man searching for something, possibly money, while a woman is distressed and injured.  The overall scene portrays the oppressive rule of the Celestial Dragons and the suffering of the townspeople. Key characters include Morley and other unnamed individuals.  The visual style is consistent with the One Piece manga aesthetic.
