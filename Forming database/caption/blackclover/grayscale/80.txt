A large, monstrous figure is disintegrating into dust, indicated by the extensive debris and dark shading.  A character, possibly Asta (judging by the style and hair), looks up in shock at the destruction.  Other characters are shown fleeing from the scene amidst a crumbling landscape. The scene is highly dynamic, showing a powerful event and its aftermath.  The onomatopoeia suggests both the disintegration of the monster and the impact of the event. The overall tone is one of intense action and devastation.
