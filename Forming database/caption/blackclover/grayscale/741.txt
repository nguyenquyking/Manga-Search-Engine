A Black Clover manga panel depicts a powerful magical attack. A monstrous, shadowy creature with horns and glowing eyes unleashes a large-scale attack on a town in the background.  A blond-haired mage, possibly Asta, is shown in a separate panel, reacting with frustration, stating he can only divert the attack despite six months of training. The scene is chaotic with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia representing the force of the attack.
