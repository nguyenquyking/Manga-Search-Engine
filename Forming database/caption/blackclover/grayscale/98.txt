A monstrous, dark-colored figure, possibly a devil fruit user, dominates the scene, addressing several smaller figures as "maggots" and "magicless nothing."  The large figure expresses weariness with their opposition, stating that their despair and resistance are merely "play-things."  The smaller figures appear terrified as the larger figure threatens to slaughter them. The text indicates the larger figure's power is possibly related to the devil, using water and rock to attack.  The final panel shows a close-up of the monster's face and a smaller character's shocked expression, suggesting the smaller character's surprise at the monster's power.  The scene is filled with dark shading and sharp lines, emphasizing the intensity and threat.
