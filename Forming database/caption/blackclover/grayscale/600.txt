Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta in a fierce battle. Asta, determined ("I'm gonna... WIN!!!") unleashes a powerful attack, represented by intense motion lines and energy bursts, targeting a monstrous opponent with sharp teeth.  The opponent roars, clearly suffering from Asta's assault.  Asta's expression is one of focused determination and exertion. The onomatopoeia "RGH" emphasizes the force of the impact and Asta's effort.  The background is largely filled with dynamic action lines.
