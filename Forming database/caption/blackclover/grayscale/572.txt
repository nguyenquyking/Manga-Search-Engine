Black Clover manga scene depicting Asta, seemingly injured and gritting his teeth, in a panel to the left. In the central panel, a powerful, dark energy blast emanating from a demonic figure, possibly Asta's Devil form, is shown striking an opponent.  The opponent is partially visible and seems to be suffering damage from the attack.  In the bottom panel, another character, possibly a comrade, looks concerned and warns Asta that continuing the attack will be fatal.  The background features a wall of skulls, adding to the dark and intense atmosphere. The overall scene suggests a fierce battle with high stakes.
