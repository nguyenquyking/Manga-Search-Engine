Black Clover manga scene depicting Asta, a young man with spiky hair and devil horns, interacting with a dark-haired character wearing glasses.  Asta expresses his desire to understand his devil partner better by befriending him, a concept the other character deems illogical and without merit due to the nature of devils.  Asta counters that his devil partner is the reason he's improved his fighting abilities.  The scene also shows a brief flashback of Asta and his devil partner fighting together.
