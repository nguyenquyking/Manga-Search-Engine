A manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A powerful, dark, demonic entity, possibly a devil, is facing off against Asta, whose blond hair is visible as he dives into the attack.  Asta's dialogue box reads, "We meet again!!", while the demonic entity expresses surprise ("Is that what this is?") and Asta's accompanying text reveals the devils' lack of emotion.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines, suggesting a fierce battle.  The overall mood is intense and confrontational.
