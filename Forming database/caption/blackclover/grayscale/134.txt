Panel 2 shows a magical energy beam emanating from a group of figures; the context suggests a victory in battle. Panel 3 shows a collage of manga panels, possibly depicting past events or flashbacks, alongside a character seemingly reacting to this.  Panel 4 shows a character, possibly an opponent, gasping ("HFF").  Panel 5 shows another character, seemingly a female, also reacting, possibly from exertion or shock. The overall scene depicts the aftermath of a significant battle, with victorious characters and defeated opponents.  The collage in Panel 3 provides narrative context.
