Black Clover manga panel depicting a massive, creepy, dark mass engulfing a character.  A blonde-haired character, possibly Asta, is being consumed, exclaiming "It's going to swallow me up!!"  Another character, a female with dark hair, observes the scene in horror, stating, "What in the world is that creepy stuff?!".  A third panel shows three smaller figures, possibly Asta's allies, within a contained energy field. The overall scene is chaotic and emphasizes the overwhelming power of the dark mass.
