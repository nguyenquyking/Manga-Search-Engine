Black Clover manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A dark, shadowy figure looms large, suggesting a powerful demonic entity. Two female characters, one with long, flowing hair (likely Morgen) and another with shorter hair, are shown reacting with fear and alarm. One is being attacked by a fiery energy blast.  The shorter-haired woman is shown in a state of distress, her face conveying shock and fear. Text boxes indicate a failed ritual and the potential destruction of a relic linked to the demonic entity.  The overall scene highlights a dangerous situation with potential catastrophic consequences.
