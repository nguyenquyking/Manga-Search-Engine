Black Clover manga panel depicting the Zogratis siblings.  A woman speaks of remaking humanity with magic.  A blurred central figure, presumably another sibling, is flanked by a man who states they will use the power of devils.  The bottom panel shows two close-ups of demonic-looking Zogratis siblings, one speaking of the prosperity of the Spade Kingdom.  The scene emphasizes the siblings' ambition and use of demonic power.
