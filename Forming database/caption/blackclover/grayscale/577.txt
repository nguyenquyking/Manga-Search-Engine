Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A higher devil throws a character (possibly Zoro, given the spiky hair) through the gate of the Underworld.  The character, lacking magic, passes through unharmed and finds themselves unexpectedly in the human world, depicted as a serene landscape with a mountain in the distance.  The scene shows the character's surprise and the aftermath of their unexpected journey.  Panel shows a close-up of the devil's hand and the character falling, followed by a wide shot of the character standing alone in the human world.
