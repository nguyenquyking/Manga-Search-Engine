A manga panel depicting a character's anticipation for a rematch.  The panel is divided into three sections. The top left shows a close-up of a character's face, seemingly gleeful, with speech bubbles indicating he's eager to fight "that boy" again.  The center and top right show a person submerged in a transparent cylindrical tank, connected to various tubes and wires.  Bubbles suggest liquid within the tank. The bottom panel shows the same tank, with a man in a fur-collared garment observing it, and another man in a suit standing in the background.  The text indicates preparations are underway.
