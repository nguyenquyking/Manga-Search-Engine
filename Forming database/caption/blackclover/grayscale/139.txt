One Piece manga panel depicting a chaotic scene where multiple characters navigate a perilous, rocky terrain.  A woman with dark hair expresses discomfort, stating "My body! It feels sort of... creepy-crawly!" Another character, possibly Licht, observes, "I can tell through my connection with Licht!!" A winged figure is seen flying away from the main group. The light is dimming, and the only escape route is to the top floor. The overall scene suggests a sense of urgency and danger.  The repeated "RM" likely represents sound effects.
