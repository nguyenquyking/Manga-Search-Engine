A manga panel depicts a confrontation between a human character and a monstrous creature. The human, using the power of a spirit and aided by elves, is battling the creature, described as anti-magic. Despite the human's efforts, the creature's heart remains impervious to the human's wind magic. The creature is large, dark, and monstrous with sharp teeth and claws, contrasted by the smaller, lighter-toned human figure.  The scene is dynamic, with lines suggesting powerful magic and movement.
