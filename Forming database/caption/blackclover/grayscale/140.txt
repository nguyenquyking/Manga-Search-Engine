Black Clover manga panel depicting a perilous scene.  A character, possibly Yami Sukehiro, expresses alarm at a large chasm and falling debris, indicated by "THOOM" sound effects.  Another panel shows two characters, possibly Asta and another knight, falling towards a light source that's vanishing. The sound "GHK" suggests impact or strain.  A close-up shows a character, potentially Licht, injured and possibly struck by a magical attack, with "Lumiere" (light) written nearby. The overall scene suggests a desperate struggle against gravity and a fading magical source.
