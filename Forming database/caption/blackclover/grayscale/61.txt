Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  Licht, a significant character, is shown in several panels.  One panel shows him with a damaged face, possibly from a battle. Another panel shows Licht, along with two other characters (one seemingly female, and another male), standing before a powerful, glowing sword or beam of light.  A fourth panel shows a crowned character, possibly a younger Licht or related individual, expressing emotion through a speech bubble.  The overall scene depicts a moment of power, possibly a magical event or a significant revelation.  The scene suggests a turning point in the narrative.
