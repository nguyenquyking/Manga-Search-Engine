One Piece manga panel depicting a large-scale destruction scene in the Heart Kingdom.  Vanica, with flowing hair, is shown mid-flight, seemingly returning to the Spade Kingdom.  Another character, possibly Noelle, is shown interacting with her, expressing disgust ("icky").  A third character, unseen but implied to be the narrator, mentions having "licked" this girl (possibly referring to Vanica's defeat).  The background shows widespread devastation and destruction caused by a powerful attack.  The scene is chaotic and dynamic, characterized by motion lines suggesting powerful energy release and large-scale destruction of buildings.
