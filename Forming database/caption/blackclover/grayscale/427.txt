A wide shot depicting a massive explosion, seemingly caused by a powerful attack,  across a vast, mountainous landscape.  The impact creates several large craters.  In a smaller panel, a female character, possibly resembling a sorceress, witnesses the event with a look of wide-eyed shock. "BOOM" and "OMP" are written in large, bold letters across the scene to emphasize the impact of the explosion.  No specific character names are identifiable beyond the female observer. The scene suggests a large-scale battle or magical event.
