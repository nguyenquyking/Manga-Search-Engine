A manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character with dark hair and a sharp, angular face, possibly a swordsman, attacks another character.  The attacker's action is described as "Slash them to ribbons". The attacked character appears to be a demonic figure with horns and a dark, armored mask.  The attacker's attack is powerful enough to seemingly cut through the second character, referencing a "test" and "gravity". The scene is dynamic, with motion lines emphasizing the speed and force of the attack.  The expressions and text suggest surprise and power.
