Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A male character with spiky hair, exhibiting a playful and flirtatious demeanor, invites a group of female characters for tea, commenting on their cuteness. Another male character, appearing distressed, observes the scene and criticizes the flirtatious male's behavior, labeling him a playboy for his instant attempts at conversation with women. The scene is framed with multiple speech bubbles containing dialogue revealing the characters' thoughts and interactions.  The overall tone suggests a lighthearted yet slightly critical commentary on the male character's actions.
