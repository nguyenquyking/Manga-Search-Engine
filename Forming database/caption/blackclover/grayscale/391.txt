Black Clover manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large, cracked map shows impending destruction, with text stating "over 90 percent of the people on this continent will die...and it will spell the end of the world!!!"  Several characters react:  One character with short hair and sunglasses expresses disbelief, stating "You'll destroy humanity too, you know!!" Another blonde female character is shocked, exclaiming "What?!"  A third, darker-haired character with glasses reveals their nonchalant attitude, stating "Humans who are weak enough to die don't interest me. I want to get all fired up with the tough guys who manage to survive in a place like that."  The scene conveys a sense of impending doom and the antagonist's cold indifference to human life.
