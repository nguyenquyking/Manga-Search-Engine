Black Clover manga panel depicting a high-intensity battle.  A character, possibly a dark magic user, is trapped within a dark, spiky prison of energy, evading attacks while stating their intention to "keep evading until [they] die." Another character, seemingly female with light-colored hair and dark horns, observes the scene, commenting on the trapped character's speed. The interaction suggests a pursuer and pursued dynamic.  The visual style is characterized by intense black and white shading with dynamic action lines.
