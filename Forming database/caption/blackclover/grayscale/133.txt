A One Piece manga panel depicting a battle.  A shadowy, monstrous figure, seemingly defeated, taunts a smaller, dark-haired character (possibly a swordsman, judging from the weaponry visible in the lower panel) who lies defeated on the ground. The monster declares the smaller character's defeat and impending disappearance. The smaller character's identity is unknown, but the monster's dialogue suggests a power imbalance. The scene is set in a desolate, rocky landscape. Blood splatter is visible.  The words "WHO ARE YOU?!" are prominent in a speech bubble.
