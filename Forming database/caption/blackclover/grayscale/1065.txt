Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dynamic action scene unfolds, featuring Asta, who is using his anti-magic powers. He's confronting two demonic entities; one, a horned, shadowy figure, is repelled by Asta's attack.  The other, a cloaked figure, is issuing commands. Speed lines and onomatopoeia (SKREE, THOOM) emphasize the intense battle.  Asta's expression is fierce, determined, as he utilizes his abilities ("Disappear") to combat the demonic forces. The overall aesthetic is high-contrast black and white, typical of manga, highlighting the powerful energy and movement.
