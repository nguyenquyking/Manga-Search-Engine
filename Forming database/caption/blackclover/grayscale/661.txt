Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene of intense magical combat.  A powerful, monstrous creature with three eyes and horns is shown descending upon a snow-covered village.  In the upper panel, several figures in dark robes engage in combat, with one character stating, "This sound...It's stupendous magic!" Another character, seemingly in command, assures someone, "Are the ones outside all right? They're fine." The overall scene conveys a sense of urgency and epic scale.
