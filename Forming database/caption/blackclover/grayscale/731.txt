Black Clover manga panel depicting a fight scene.  A female character with long hair, possibly a witch, is restrained by thorny, dark vines or magic. She expresses affection, stating she likes the unseen opponent. Another character, a girl with shorter hair, is shown in a separate panel, seemingly observing or reacting to the scene.  A third panel shows a close-up of the restrained female character's face, now seemingly more aggressive and issuing a challenge or invitation.  The scene is dynamic with motion lines indicating struggle and impact. The word "Charlotte" is visible in a speech bubble.
