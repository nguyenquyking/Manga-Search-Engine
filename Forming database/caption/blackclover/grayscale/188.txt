Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where Augustus Kira is confronted by several individuals.  Kira is surrounded by three cloaked figures holding books, likely representing magic.  A separate panel shows a character, possibly Asta, reacting to the situation with an expression of triumph, stating it was an "easy win".  The text indicates that Kira is about to be relieved of his life by Augustus Kira and his team.  The presence of a single, low-ranking Magic Knight with Kira is deemed inconsequential.
