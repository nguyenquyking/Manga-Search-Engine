One Piece manga panel depicting a dramatic battle scene. A horned, demonic figure unleashes a "Spatial Rupture," shattering the surrounding environment into jagged fragments.  A character, possibly Asta (from Black Clover, judging by the art style), struggles to counter the attack, stating his inability to regenerate the broken space immediately. Another character observes the scene, commenting on the weakness of those caught in the attack and the impossibility of protecting everyone. The text indicates a plan to regenerate the affected characters later.  The overall tone is one of intense destruction and desperate action.
