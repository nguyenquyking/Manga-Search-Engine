A manga panel depicting a scene where a prince is hailed as a Messiah for defeating a monster.  People celebrate in a town in the background.  In the foreground, a dark entity, possibly the defeated monster's remnant, speaks, commenting on being prevented from gaining a physical body. A female character, possibly a magic user, is ordered to hand over a grimoire. The overall tone is celebratory, yet tinged with dark undertones from the defeated entity's commentary.
