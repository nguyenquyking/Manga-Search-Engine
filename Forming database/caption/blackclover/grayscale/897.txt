Black Clover manga scene:  Lolopechka, appearing ethereal and surrounded by light, invites another character (possibly a fellow magic knight) to join her in defeating Vanica and rescuing Lolopechka.  Simultaneously, a separate panel shows a fierce battle where a dark-cloaked figure confronts another character.  A third panel depicts a grinning woman, possibly a mentor figure, observing and commenting on Lolopechka's enjoyment of the battle.  The overall tone suggests a climactic battle with a focus on teamwork and empowerment.
