A monstrous, shadowy creature, possibly from another dimension, dominates the scene.  Its form is composed of numerous tendrils and resembles a large, dark bird or beast.  The text indicates this is "Our Dimension of Origin."  Several characters react in shock. One character, possibly a woman, expresses disbelief at seeing this otherworldly entity.  Another character, appearing to be a man,  is visibly surprised and questions the nature of a spell.  A third character is partially visible, observing the unfolding event.  The creature's presence creates a chaotic and ominous atmosphere.  A book, possibly magical, lies open near the creature's base.
