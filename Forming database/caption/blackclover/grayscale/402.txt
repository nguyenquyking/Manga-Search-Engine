A character with a crown and dark, spiky hair (likely a villain) is unleashing a powerful energy attack, represented by swirling, radiating lines.  The attack's percentage completion is shown as 65%, 66%, and 67% across sequential panels. Another character, with shorter hair and a worried expression, is shown reacting to the attack, stating "I'm coming, okay?!" and "Here I come, okay?".
