Black Clover manga volume 27 cover featuring Nacht Faust.  Nacht, with his signature half-black, half-white hair, is shown from the chest up, partially obscured by large, shadowy hands.  His expression is subtly sinister. The title "Black Clover" and volume number 27 are prominently displayed, along with the subtitle "The Devil-Binding Ritual."  The overall aesthetic is dark and ominous.
