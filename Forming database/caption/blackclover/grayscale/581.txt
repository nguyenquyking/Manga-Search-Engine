A manga panel depicts a scene with three characters. A young woman with short hair, possibly Asta's mother, explains that she lives outside the village because her body steals magic and life from those nearby.  A small, dark-haired child, possibly a devil, is shown with stitched-up wounds on his face,  and seems to be the source of the magic and life drain.  A third character, a smiling young woman, observes the interaction and remarks about a feeling of fate. The background includes a simple village house and barren trees, suggesting isolation.  The panel showcases a supernatural element with dark, swirling energy emanating from the child.
