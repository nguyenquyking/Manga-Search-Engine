Two women, Undine and another unnamed character, are shown in conversation. Undine, wearing glasses, expresses surprise and states her selfish desire. The other woman, with wavy hair, acknowledges Undine's kindness and declares it to be her pride and joy. The scene then shifts to a wide shot showing a figure standing near a large, tree-like structure, possibly a magical element. Text boxes reveal Undine's past actions, including keeping Lolopechka away from a fight and remaining silent about Saint Stage even during the appearance of Devil Hosts in the Spade Kingdom.  The overall theme centers on Undine's motivations and her past actions related to a significant conflict.
