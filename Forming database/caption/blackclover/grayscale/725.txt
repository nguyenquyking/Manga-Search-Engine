A winged, dark-haired character, possibly a devil or demonic entity, is central, surrounded by intense action lines suggesting a powerful attack or impact.  In the background, three smaller, winged figures are shown, seemingly defeated or fleeing.  A character with dark clothing and wings is visible in the upper-left corner, possibly engaging in combat. The bottom panel shows a close-up of another dark, horned creature, possibly another devil, reacting to the central character's attack.  The overall scene is chaotic and suggests a high-stakes confrontation with magical abilities.  Specific character names are not visible.
