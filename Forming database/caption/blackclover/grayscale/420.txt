Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  A character with horns and dark clothing suggests taking Lolo-Pechka to the Spade Kingdom, while another character expresses indifference. A third character, seemingly distressed, is shown in the background.  The dialogue reveals a plan, possibly involving the destruction of the "wisdom" of the Heart Kingdom.  The visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga's dark and dramatic aesthetic.
