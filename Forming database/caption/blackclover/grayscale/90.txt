A Black Clover manga panel depicts Asta using Demon Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction.  Asta, with a determined expression and one eye obscured by dark markings, unleashes the attack, shown as numerous light swords obliterating a shadowy, monstrous entity. The words "ASH" and "WHOOSH" illustrate the destructive force of the attack.  Asta's internal monologue indicates his intention to protect something.  Smaller panels show a flashback possibly detailing the nature of the threat.
