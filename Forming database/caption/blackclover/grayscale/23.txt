Two Black Clover characters discuss sealing magic. One, with short bobbed hair, excitedly explains the potential for societal equality by allowing those with less magical ability to use spells via magic items. The other, with shorter, spikier hair, is amazed by the concept of "sealing magic," deeming it unusual and terrific.  The scene shows the second character in a workshop, creating magic items, highlighting the practical application of the discussed magic.
