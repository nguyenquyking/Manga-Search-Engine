Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where several characters react to a powerful display of magic.  Master Yuno is the focus, his wind magic manifested as bright, vertical beams of light emanating from a dark, barren landscape.  Another character, possibly Tetia, comments on the light and wind magic.  Other figures are present, observing the event from a distance, appearing fearful or in awe.  The scene's overall atmosphere is one of intense magical power and ominous foreboding.
