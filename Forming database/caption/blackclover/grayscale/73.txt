A Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a demonic entity.  Asta, with surprised expression, questions the nature of magic in this world, pondering whether widespread access to magical abilities would create a better society.  The demonic entity, whose body is described as stunted and magic as worthless, explains that everyone possesses unique potential, and that magic in this world is readily available, even to those without inherent magical prowess, implying a parasitic nature.  Another panel shows two individuals observing from afar.  Asta's determined opponent, with intense eyes, asserts that those previously underestimated will defeat him.
