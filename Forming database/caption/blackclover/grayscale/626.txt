Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, possessed by Liebe, defeated and on the ground.  Asta is visibly injured and distressed.  A shadowy figure, likely a high-ranking Dark Triad member, stands over him, declaring "YOU LOSE AGAIN."  Several other shadowy figures with devil-like halos surround them. The scene is set against a cracked, rocky background, suggesting a battle.  The overall mood is one of defeat and impending doom for Asta.
