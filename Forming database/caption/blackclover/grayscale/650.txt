A manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters and expressions.  A magic knight, visibly stressed, reacts to a mission order from a king (seen in a smaller inset panel). He complains about the dangerous nature of his mission and the individuals involved.  The panel then shifts to show him at a party, contrasting with his current situation. Finally, the panel shows the magic knight encountering two other seemingly less skilled individuals, who he berates for their lack of skill while on the mission.  The overall mood is one of tension and exasperated annoyance.
