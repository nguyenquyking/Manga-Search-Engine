Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a young man with spiky hair and a grimace, in handcuffs, being interrogated.  Nobles dressed in ornate clothing express disgust.  Text indicates Asta is an orphan from the Forsaken Realm with no detectable magic.  A separate panel shows a girl with horns, also in a courtroom setting; text confirms the horns are proof of forbidden magic and that the kingdom has no record of her birth.  The scene suggests a trial or investigation concerning Asta and the horned girl.
