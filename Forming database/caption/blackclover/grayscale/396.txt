A Black Clover manga panel depicts a battle between Acier Silva of the Clover Kingdom and an unidentified opponent.  Acier, in a mermaid-like form, is rapidly moving through water, her power increasing to 51%, then 52%. The opponent, shown in multiple panels, is visibly excited and energized by Acier's power surge.  The opponentâ€™s dialogue indicates a connection to Acier's mother's death.  The scene is dynamic, with intense motion lines emphasizing Acier's speed and the opponent's excitement.  The overall visual style is characteristic of the Black Clover manga's action-oriented aesthetic.
