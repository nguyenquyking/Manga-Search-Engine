Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A character with horns and dark markings on his face, possibly Asta or a similar character, is challenged by a larger, more shadowy figure. The larger figure scoffs at the smaller character's "cheap talk," urging him to demonstrate his skills instead. The smaller character responds by ignoring the larger figure and seemingly preparing for a physical attack; a strong punch is implied.  The scene is dynamic and emphasizes the characters' contrasting power levels.
