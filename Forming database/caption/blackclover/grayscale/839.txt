Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Two devil-like figures with horned masks, one with a single visible eye, are shown in the upper panels, suggesting an attack.  The lower panel shows a battle scene; a dark-cloaked figure, possibly Asta, kneels amidst rubble, facing a shadowy, spiky magical entity.  The text indicates a magical power struggle, with one character's body magic overpowering the other's adaptable magic.
