A manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large section of a snowy mountainside has vanished, creating a gaping hole.  A character, possibly Asta (judging from the style and presence of his anti-magic grimoire), is shown in the foreground, his wings spread, seemingly responsible for the disappearance. Another character, possibly a surprised ally, is shown in a separate panel, reacting with shock and exclaiming "What the...?" The background shows a mountainous landscape, and the onomatopoeia "GRUNCH" and "WHOOSH" suggest the magnitude of the event.  The overall atmosphere is one of awe and fear.
