One Piece manga scene depicting a battle.  A large, obese Devil Host with a long tongue attacks two female characters. One, with long blonde hair, is restrained by the tongue. The other, with shorter blonde hair, directs her attack elsewhere. The Devil Host laughs.  The short-haired woman explains that she used magic-controlling weed seeds in her last attack, now affecting the Devil Host.  The Devil Host reacts negatively to this.
