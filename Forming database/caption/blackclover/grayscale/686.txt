Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a spiky-haired boy, and a dark-cloaked figure. Asta expresses confidence ("It's working!! We'll beat this guy, stop the advent of Qliphot...") while observing the dark figure who seems to be bleeding dark liquid.  The lower panel shows a scene where Captain Yami Sukehiro is trapped in a coffin-like structure, seemingly made of stone or tree bark, which is being attacked by dark tendrils. Asta's goal is to rescue Captain Yami Sukehiro ("...and rescue Captain Vangeance!!!") from this situation. The overall scene is dark and intense, emphasizing a battle against dark magic.
