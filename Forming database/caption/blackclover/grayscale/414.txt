Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, seemingly Lolopechka, is disintegrating, surrounded by magical energy and dark, swirling matter.  Another character, possibly a powerful antagonist, observes, stating, "That's enough of that!!!"  A third character, seemingly unimpressed, comments, "Maaâ€¦ boring much?"  The antagonist previously stated, "Without Lolopechka's magic, you're nothing special," suggesting the disintegration is due to the loss of magical power.  The scene conveys a power differential and the defeat of Lolopechka.
