Black Clover manga panel depicting a hierarchy of ten devils matched to Qliphoth in separate locations.  A diagram shows devils arranged in tiers, with strength increasing at deeper levels.  A character, possibly Asta (blond hair) and another character (gold helmet) discuss the power levels of the lower-level devils, noting they are even more powerful than the upper-level devils who are the equals of the Dark Triad.  A third character with dark hair observes the diagram.  The visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga.
