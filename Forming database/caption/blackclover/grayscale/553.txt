A manga panel depicts a conversation between several characters.  A woman with short, wavy hair expresses her preference for a vice-captain position for its freedom and convenience.  A man with short, dark hair and a serious expression declares his hatred for the Black Bulls.  Another character, seemingly a male, questions the manâ€™s assessment of the Black Bulls, pointing out their role in a past war and their reputation as a "brigade of good-for-nothings". The background shows a courtyard with other figures, possibly Black Bulls members.  The scene focuses on internal conflict and differing opinions regarding the Black Bulls.
