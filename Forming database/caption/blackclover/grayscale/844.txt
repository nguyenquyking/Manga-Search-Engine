Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A powerful, horned, devil-like figure confidently declares he will defeat his opponents alone, emphasizing the inferiority of their magic.  The scene shows multiple characters, including Asta (implied, not explicitly shown) and another magic user, facing a superior antagonist who dismisses their combined strength.  The dialogue highlights the antagonist's overwhelming magical power and his disdain for his opponents. The setting appears to be a grand, possibly palatial interior.
