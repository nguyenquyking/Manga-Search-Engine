One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A character (likely female, based on the eye and hair suggestions) with intense, wide eyes shouts "Shut your mouth!!" at another character, partially obscured, who responds with "Just...". The first character's anger is emphasized by the harsh lines and text bubbles.  The second character is described as someone who "does whatever she wants and laughs like an idiot," while the first character notes that "kind people get hurt and cry." The scene features powerful energy blasts or magic effects, depicted with spiky lines and radiating energy emanating from the second character. The final panel shows a close-up of the first character's eye, suggesting shock or disbelief, with the word "Just..." repeated in the speech bubble.  The overall mood is one of conflict and frustrated anger.
