Black Clover manga panel depicting a chaotic scene.  A monstrous, dark magic entity from another world is attacking.  Yami is shown in distress, possibly injured, with Asta reacting with shock and concern.  Other Black Bulls members, including a female member, are also present and appear distressed by the situation. The entity is described as "slimy, putrid" by a character.  The overall mood is tense and dangerous.  The visual style is typical of Black Clover, with heavy use of motion lines and visual effects to portray the impact of the dark magic.
