The devil is actively attacking, creating a powerful energy blast.  The shorter character is defending,  engaging in close-quarters combat. The background shows a broken brick wall.  The devil is speaking, inviting the other character to continue the fight.  Dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia emphasize the intensity of the combat.
