Black Clover manga panel depicting Yuno, a young man with spiky dark hair, levitating amidst a dark, star-shaped magical aura.  The text "Star Magic" is prominently displayed above him.  Two open books float beside him.  In a separate panel, a close-up shows a bloodied face, with text stating, "A son of the royals!!". Another panel shows a joyful, close-up of a woman's face, possibly expressing recognition of Yuno.  The overall scene suggests a magical transformation or revelation of Yuno's royal lineage.
