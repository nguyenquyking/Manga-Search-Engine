Black Clover manga scene depicting Asta's smaller form, interacting with other characters.  Asta, now smaller, is surprised by a character (possibly Liebe) while another character explains that his magic is greatly weakened due to the Monarchist Nobles' influence. A mysterious circular structure, labeled "Swallow-Tail," is shown, described as ancient magic storage technology.  The scene shows a contrast between Asta's diminished state and the discovery of the ancient magic technology.
