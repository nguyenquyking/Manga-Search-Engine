Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A female character with dark hair and devilish features, possibly a demon, is attacking another female character with light hair and large wings, who seems to be a magical knight.  The devil-like character is gleefully declaring "Entertain me Moooore..." while the winged character is reacting defensively and possibly using a magic attack labeled "Acier!!".  A speech bubble indicates that an observer finds both combatants' power fantastic.  The overall scene is dynamic and suggests intense magical combat.
