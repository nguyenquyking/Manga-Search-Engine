A Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A female character, possibly Noelle Silva (judging by the crown-like hair ornament and magical energy), unleashes a powerful water-based attack, shown as swirling, dark energy emanating from her. She declares, "I'M NOT DONE YET!"  The lower panel shows a close-up of another character's wide, expressive eyes, possibly an opponent, who comments, "...HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT."  and "POWER DIFFERENTIALS..." suggesting a significant power disparity between the two combatants.  The overall scene is dynamic and action-packed, highlighting the intensity of the magical confrontation.
