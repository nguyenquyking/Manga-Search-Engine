Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between Yami Sukehiro, Asta, and a female character (likely a Black Bull member).  Yami is smoking, observing the interaction between Asta and the woman who is visibly flustered and unable to express herself, despite wanting to confess her feelings for Yami. Asta is looking on, seemingly understanding the situation and commenting on Yamiâ€™s obliviousness.  The scene is filled with internal monologues expressing the woman's nervousness and Yami's blunt and dense personality.  Asta points out Yami's lack of awareness of the woman's discomfort.
