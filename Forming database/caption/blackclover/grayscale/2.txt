Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character with spiky hair (likely Asta) uses dark magic, creating a large, swirling, dark energy attack.  Another character is shown being impacted by this attack, their body reacting to the force.  Text bubbles indicate Asta is testing the opponent's defenses and overcoming them with his word soul magic.  The background features thorny, plant-like energy effects. The overall scene is dynamic and action-packed, showcasing a powerful magic attack.
