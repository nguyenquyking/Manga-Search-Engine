Two demonic figures, possibly representing a single entity, with dark, shadowy features, large wings, and horns, stand prominently in the upper panel.  They are humanoid in form but possess monstrous attributes.  Below, a close-up of a character's wide, expressive eye suggests fear or awe, followed by a partially visible figure, possibly Asta (though confirmation is needed due to the limited view), facing the demonic figures. The overall scene depicts a confrontation, highlighting the imposing presence of the demonic beings and the character's reaction to their power.
