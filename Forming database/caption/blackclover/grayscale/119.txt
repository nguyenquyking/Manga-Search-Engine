Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle. Asta, strained and possibly at his limit, is shown in multiple panels, gritting his teeth, his body showing signs of exertion.  Another character, possibly Licht, is seen wielding a powerful light-based attack, energized and exclaiming about the power surging through them.  The scene is dynamic, filled with motion lines and energy blasts suggesting a high-stakes confrontation.  The visual focus is on the clash of power between Asta and the light-wielding opponent.
