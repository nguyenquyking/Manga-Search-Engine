Black Clover manga scene depicting a powerful demonic transformation. A character, seemingly the antagonist, undergoes a drastic physical change, becoming monstrous and significantly larger, with dark, spiky features and a large, circular symbol on their chest.  The transformation is accompanied by intense visual effects and onomatopoeia ("KRAK").  The antagonist's dialogue reveals their power is linked to body magic, enhancing regeneration but resulting in an undesirable, monstrous form.  Other characters, likely allies, react with shock and concern, their expressions conveying fear and awe. The antagonist shows a mixture of satisfaction and disgust at their transformation.  A grimoire or magic book is visible in the antagonist's possession.
