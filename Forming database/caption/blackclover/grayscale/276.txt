A family portrait of Nathan, Jonna, Roxanne, and Nilenia.  All family members have identical, emotionless faces with large, empty eyes.  Gordon has just arrived home.  Two additional characters in the lower panel react with shock to the family's identical appearances, exclaiming "They all have the same face!!"  The scene is darkly lit and has a slightly unsettling atmosphere.
