Black Clover manga panel depicting a fast-paced battle.  A character, possibly Asta, wielding a dark, cube-shaped object, lunges forward, motion lines indicating high speed.  He is striking a female character, likely Noelle Silva, who is shown recoiling with a surprised expression, her body partially obscured by an energy blast.  In the background, a dark, bat-like creature is visible amid a chaotic explosion.  Noelle's attack is met with a forceful counter from Asta.  Another panel shows a close-up of a mysterious, stone-like object with strange markings, potentially a magical artifact or inscription. The onomatopoeia "Lolo-Pech-Kaaaaaa!!!" suggests a powerful attack.
