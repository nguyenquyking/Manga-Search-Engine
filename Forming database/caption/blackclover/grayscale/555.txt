A manga panel depicts a conversation between several characters.  A dark-haired man with a stern expression asserts that those who are inherently good, rather than those who reform, are the greatest. He criticizes the appearance of other characters, implying that their looks make people misjudge them.  The scene includes three women with light-colored hair in the background and a single man in a cloak in the foreground of the next panel. The dialogue focuses on the superficiality of judging people by their appearance.
