A grayscale manga panel depicting a character's solemn reflection.  The top panel shows a close-up of an eye, with the character stating, "I know my limits." Subsequent panels show a figure at a grave in the rain, a second figure with long hair bowed over a grave,  and a third figure, possibly a younger man with spiky hair and a katana, declaring his ambition to "make my own brigade." The overall mood is somber and determined.
