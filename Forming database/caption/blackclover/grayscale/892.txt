A manga panel depicts a narrative about Lolopechka.  The first panel shows a woman with long hair, possibly a queen or protector, expressing concern about Lolopechka's magical power not being used in a formal setting.  Subsequent panels show a flashback: a young Lolopechka with immense magic,  her interaction with the Heart Kingdom's queen, and her eventual meeting with Lolopechka as a child.  The overall theme is the history and potential of Lolopechka's magical abilities and her relationship with the Heart Kingdom.
