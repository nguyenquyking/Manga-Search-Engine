Black Clover manga panel depicting several high-ranking devils.  A large, central devil with multiple eyes and spindly limbs is shown interacting with smaller, grotesque devils. Text bubbles indicate the devils are enjoying a game, consuming mana, and discussing the difficulty of defeating higher-level devils. A smaller panel shows a blonde-haired individual, possibly a mage, seemingly strategizing against these devils, referencing mana usage and arcane stage limitations.  The overall scene suggests a confrontation between devils and a magical user.
