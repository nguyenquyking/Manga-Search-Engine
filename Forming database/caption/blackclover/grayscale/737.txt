A massive, monstrous creature, possibly a magical being, dominates the scene. Its design features a skeletal, dark body with a grotesque, multi-eyed face.  It's overwhelmingly large compared to the smaller human figures fleeing in terror.  A character, possibly a mage, attempts to use "Vortex Magic Area Helix," a powerful spell, against it but is clearly outmatched.  The spell is depicted as a swirling vortex of energy.  Other human characters are shown running away, expressing fear and desperation. The text bubbles indicate the characters' reactions to the creature's immense size and power, emphasizing their helplessness.
