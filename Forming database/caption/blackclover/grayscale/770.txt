A Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A demonic figure with horns and a single visible eye threatens a man in a dark coat, who appears surprised.  The demonic figure states, "I'll slash you up!!" while the man in the coat recalls, "You're fighting me, remember?!"  A smaller, horned figure is shown in a separate panel, seemingly reporting to the larger demonic figure.  The scene is dark and intense, highlighting the conflict between the characters.  The smaller figure's dialogue suggests the larger demonic figure's opponent, Jack, is in trouble.
