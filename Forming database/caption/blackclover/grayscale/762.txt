Black Clover manga panel depicting four female characters listening attentively to an off-panel speaker.  The speech bubbles explain that training in Elysia allows mages to draw closer to mana, artificially using more magic than they possess, specifically achieving "Ultimate Magic" through the superhuman power of "True Magic" and utilizing a mana method from the Heart Kingdom.  The panel also shows a montage of action-packed scenes, suggesting the power of this magic. The six months of training are confirmed to have been successful.  No character names are visible.
