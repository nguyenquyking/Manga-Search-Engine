One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with two female characters.  A character with horns and dark, flowing hair uses "Curse-Warding Magic: Exploding Life," creating dark, swirling energy and causing multiple explosions.  Another character with pale skin, horns, and multiple eyes observes, expressing confusion. The first character's magic is causing a powerful effect, visible as dark, tentacle-like energy emanating from her. The panel shows a dynamic action sequence with a focus on the magical ability.
