Black Clover manga panel depicting a young man, seemingly a spatial mage, in a dark coat holding a grimoire.  He is surrounded by dark, spiky energy emanating from him, suggesting the use of spatial magic. The text indicates that only those with significant mana reserves and those who have mastered "Mana Zone" can utilize this type of magic. A figure in a flowing robe is visible in a smaller panel, possibly representing a more powerful mage. The overall scene emphasizes the rarity and power of spatial magic within the Black Clover universe.
