Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene of devastation.  A destroyed building is shown in the background. In the foreground, several characters from the Black Bulls are gathered: Asta (surprised expression), Noelle Silva (concerned), Mimosa Vermillion (worried), and a fourth Black Bull (likely Nacht, the vice-captain, though his face is obscured). They are discussing an impending attack on the Spade Kingdom, with the vice-captain stating their intent to marshal the Magic Knights' elite in three days.  The scene highlights the urgency and seriousness of the situation.
