A manga panel depicting a magical battle.  A character, possibly a female, unleashes "True Briar Magic," manifesting as a swirling, rose-petal-filled attack labeled "Rightful Red Rose." Another character, a man with a shocked expression, is caught in the attack. A third character, possibly a clown-like figure, is visible in the lower panel.  The scene is dynamic, with intense action lines suggesting powerful magic in use.
