Black Clover manga panel depicting seven characters, Asta, Noelle Silva, Magna Swing, Luck Voltia, Charmy Pappitson,  Yami Sukehiro, and Gauche Adlai,  exultantly shouting, faces bloodied and bruised, after being granted the title of "Strongest."  Below them, a close-up of an unseen, ominous figure's eyes is visible.  The overall mood is triumphant yet foreboding.
