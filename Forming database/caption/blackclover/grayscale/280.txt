He states his reason is to help a friend.  The officer's face is partially obscured, showing only his eyes and mouth.  In a separate panel, Asta and a female companion (likely Noelle Silva) are shown reacting to this information, displaying concerned expressions.  Another panel shows a man in formal attire, possibly a mage specializing in curses,  preparing to reveal his expertise, implying he will assist the officer. A final panel shows a group of people sitting at a table, possibly observing the situation.
