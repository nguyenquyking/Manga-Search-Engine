Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, Noelle Silva, Mimosa Vermillion, and a partially visible character (likely Finral Roulacase). Asta and Mimosa are expressing determination, with Asta stating, "You can count on us!" Noelle, in a separate panel, expresses gratitude, saying "Thank you for your help!!"  The scene suggests a collaborative effort and mutual support among the characters.  The overall visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga's art.
