Black Clover manga scene: Asta and another character (possibly a dark magic user) are in a ruined building.  Asta expresses surprise, noting the lack of anything there.  The scene then shifts to a dark, ominous area, described as a "Dark Garden Invitation," filled with skulls and dark magical circles. Asta is present and seemingly observing a cloaked figure interacting with a book within the dark garden. A shadowy figure uses shadow magic in the first panel.
