Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A powerful, skeletal-appearing character boasts about his invincibility, stating no spell can defeat him.  Another character, seemingly weaker, is shown charging his mana, acknowledging the opponent's overwhelming strength but expressing determination. A third character, possibly a leader, reflects on their past strength and the invincibility of their spatial magic.  The scene showcases a stark power imbalance, with the first character possessing significantly greater magical abilities.  The visual elements highlight the contrast in power levels through differing line weights and the skeletal appearance of the dominant character.
