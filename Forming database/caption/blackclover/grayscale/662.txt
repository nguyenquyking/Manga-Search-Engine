A monstrous, decaying face dominates the left side of the panel, its mouth agape in a roar, emitting a powerful blast of energy depicted by sharp, black lines radiating outwards.  A smaller figure, seemingly a character, is flung backwards and away from the blast's epicenter. The visual style suggests intense energy and impact. The onomatopoeia "FNOOOOM" emphasizes the force of the attack. The scene depicts a powerful attack, likely from the monstrous entity, against a smaller, fleeing opponent.  No specific character names are visually identifiable.
