Black Clover manga scene: Asta, desperate, begs Liebe (a devil residing within him) to teach him how to use the devil's power. Liebe, unimpressed by Asta's abilities so far, notes Asta's honesty as a positive trait but insists on rest before training.  Asta's determined expression contrasts with Liebe's more apathetic one.  The scene is set in a simple, stone-walled background.  A small, unseen character is present in the background.
