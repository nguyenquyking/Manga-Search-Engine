One Piece manga panel depicting a scene in a library-like setting with floating bookshelves.  A man in a lab coat, possibly a scientist, is levitating, having discovered a way to accelerate the growth of the Qliphoth tree. Another man, seemingly observing, comments on the situation, reflecting on the exchange of blindness for such abilities.  The panels also show smaller inset panels possibly depicting previous events or related context. The overall tone suggests a revelation of significant power and a philosophical reflection on its cost.
