Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  A muscular male character, possibly Yami Sukehiro, sits at a table with a blonde female character, likely Noelle Silva, discussing a curse affecting her. The curse, described as a forbidden magic, altered Noelle's soul and magic, stemming from a curse mage's grudge against her family.  The panel includes visual representations of the curse's effect and a book possibly related to the magic.
