Black Clover manga panel depicting Mimosa Vermillion, adorned in a floral dress and crown, holding an open book surrounded by flowers.  A speech bubble above her states, "Mimosa can do it!!". Below, a close-up of another character's determined face,  declares, "I'm not letting anyone die!!". The scene suggests a moment of intense magical healing or spellcasting, possibly a life-or-death situation.
