Asta, initially shown expressing frustration at the tedious nature of mana study, is lectured by another character (possibly a teacher) on the necessity of understanding mana and self-knowledge for spellcasting.  The panel includes multiple smaller illustrations showcasing Asta's struggles with studying and notes on mana, contrasted with the effortless spellcasting he's used to. The teacher emphasizes that Asta's impatience and lack of understanding are hindering his progress.  The overall scene focuses on Asta's learning process and the importance of fundamental knowledge in magic.
