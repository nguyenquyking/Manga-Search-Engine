Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta's trial.  Asta, appearing shocked, is seen in the lower panel before a tribunal of robed figures.  A stern-faced judge (likely the main antagonist) comments on Asta's situation in the top panel. The text bubbles indicate a debate about the existence of devils and Asta's potential manipulation.  The overall scene suggests a courtroom setting where Asta is being judged.
