Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a young man with spiky hair and a determined expression, bruised and battered.  He is being addressed by a dark-haired individual, whose face is partially obscured but shows a skeptical and slightly mocking expression. A third figure, in dark robes, stands silently in the background.  The scene showcases a dialogue revealing Asta's lack of magic and his pursuit of strength, contrasted with the other character's disbelief that he could achieve significant gains in just two days through legitimate means. The final panel shows Asta's transformation, his face contorted in a monstrous grin, suggesting a drastic change possibly due to unconventional methods.  The overall mood is tense and hints at a significant power shift.
