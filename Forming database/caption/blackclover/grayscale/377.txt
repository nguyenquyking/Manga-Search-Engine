A black-haired character with a mask, possibly Asta from Black Clover, uses a powerful attack, depicted by large impact sound effects ("KABLAM," "GRUNCH"), causing significant damage and explosions.  The attack targets at least two shocked, light-haired characters who are shown reacting with surprise and fear ("Wha...", "What are you?!").  The scene showcases a dynamic action sequence with clear expressions of power and astonishment.
