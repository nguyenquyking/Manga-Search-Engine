Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, Liebe, and an unnamed opponent.  Asta, in a strained, determined expression, has activated Devil Union, his body showing signs of exertion and damage. Liebe is beside him, also showing signs of strain. Their opponent, a dark-haired individual, smirks, acknowledging Asta's Devil Union but declaring that he will still be the strongest. The scene shows a power struggle, with Asta and Liebe having seemingly exhausted themselves in their effort.  The panels show a sequence of events: Asta's determination, the opponent's acknowledgement of Asta's power, and finally Asta's surprise at the opponent's continued strength.
