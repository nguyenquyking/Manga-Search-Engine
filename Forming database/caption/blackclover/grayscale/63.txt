A manga panel depicting a scene from what seems to be a magical battle.  Lumiere, a pale-skinned character with pointed ears and multiple eyes, observes a group of figures—possibly Asta and the Black Bulls—standing on a floating rock, emanating light. Patry, another character, is shown in a separate panel, reflecting on their past actions and the influence of Lumiere.  Flashbacks reveal scenes of a dark, ominous figure and a past event involving a devil's plan, five hundred years prior.  The overall tone is serious and dramatic, suggesting a pivotal moment in the narrative.
