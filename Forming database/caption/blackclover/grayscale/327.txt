Here's a concise caption describing the One Piece manga comic image:  A mage apologizes for compelling three younger mages into a fight to assess their magical strength, explaining that in magic battles, individual power surpasses numbers.  The scene shows a powerful mage observing the fight where the strength of magic is inversely proportional to the assigned stage number (9, 8, 7). Another mage emphasizes that true strength lies in the potency of one's magic, not the number of participants.
