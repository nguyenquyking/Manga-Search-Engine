A manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character with long, dark hair is shown suffering a powerful attack, indicated by crackling energy and onomatopoeia ("krak," "sizzzz," "shur").  The character is clearly in pain, as shown by their expression and body language.  Another character, smaller and less detailed, is partially visible in the background, seemingly the source or target of the attack. The scene is highly dynamic, emphasizing the intensity of the combat with sharp lines and strong contrasts. The visual style is consistent with One Piece manga.
