Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A female character, possibly Asta's ally, stands amidst magical flames and ice shards,  wounded but defiant.  She states, "Thanks to you, I got stronger," implying a previous collaboration. Another character, possibly a member of the Dark Triad, is shown in a separate panel,  commenting on her lateness and declaring that she doesn't matter. The scene suggests a significant moment in the fight against the Dark Triad.  The overall tone is intense and action-oriented.
