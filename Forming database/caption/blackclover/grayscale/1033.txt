Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows two Golden Dawn members, likely  Noelle Silva and Asta (though not explicitly named), being healed by a magical fairy-like creature after a battle.  The fairy states she made it "in time". Another member instructs them to find a recovery mage. The second panel shows Noelle and Asta's shocked reactions, with a text box identifying a "four-leaf grimoire and a second grimoire". The third panel focuses on a close-up of Asta, identified as the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn, with blood around his mouth.
