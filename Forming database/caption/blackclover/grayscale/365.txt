One Piece manga panel depicting a scene where a large, grinning man assigns a task to a group of seemingly weak magic users.  He states their magic is only useful for assisting the propulsion system.  A woman is shown being forcefully stripped, her terrified expression visible. The man laughs maniacally, implying the task is demeaning and exploitative.  The overall tone is menacing and suggests a power imbalance.
