Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple characters and scenes.  A woman with glasses declares "I will save you. No matter what!!" to a scarred, intense-looking man.  Another panel shows a woman, possibly a queen or high-ranking official, with a concerned expression saying "...Yami!!"  A third panel shows a younger character, possibly a knight, seemingly observing the scene with resolve.  A final panel shows a wide shot of a large city or town in the distance.  The overall scene suggests a moment of urgency and determination during a critical event.
