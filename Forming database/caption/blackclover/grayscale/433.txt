A Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  One character, with spiky hair, performs a "Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash," creating a large, dark, swirling vortex.  Another character, seemingly dodging the attack, is shown in motion, planning a counter-attack, aiming to get "right up in his face."  The background shows a snowy mountainous landscape.  The text indicates a strategic battle involving manipulation of gravity and dimensional slashes.
