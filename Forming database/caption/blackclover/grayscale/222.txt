A large explosion occurs in a stadium, witnessed by a shocked audience.  The onlookers, exhibiting fear and confusion, are shown reacting with expressions of alarm.  The text "MTR" is repeatedly shown near them, possibly indicating a sound effect or a name relevant to the event.  In a subsequent panel, Asta (with his signature anti-magic grimoire) and a man with slicked-back hair observe the aftermath of the explosion with expressions of astonishment. The scene is characterized by intense action and suspense.
