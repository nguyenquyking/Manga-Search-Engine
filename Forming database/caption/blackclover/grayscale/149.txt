A Black Clover manga panel depicting Patry, his face partially obscured by shadows and blood, his hands clasped to his chest.  He's dressed in a toga-like garment.  Text bubbles indicate he's resolving to end his anger and grief.  In another panel, Captain Yami Sukehiro (Captain Vengeance) observes Patry, looking concerned. A third panel shows a close-up of Patry's face, emphasizing the blood and darkness.  The overall scene suggests a moment of emotional resolution and reflection within a larger conflict.
