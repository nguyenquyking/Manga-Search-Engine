Black Clover manga panel depicting Lady Tetia, seemingly deceased but alive, lying on the ground.  A person (possibly a magic user) is shown holding a jeweled object, possibly related to the magic used to save Tetia.  Another character, a young woman with horns, is shown crying, expressing relief and sorrow.  The narrative indicates Tetia's life was saved, and the other character's actions in tending to her wounds are described.  The final panel shows a flashback, where the horned woman appears as a bird, many years after the event.  The scene emphasizes the themes of survival, magic, and the passage of time.
