Black Clover manga panel depicting two female characters.  A witch-like figure with a large, flower-adorned hat gestures to a younger woman with blonde pigtails, who is wearing a black cloak with a black bull emblem. The witch is shushing the younger woman and warns her not to mention something Nozel didn't tell her, or she'll get cursed. A separate panel shows two figures, possibly the same two women, on a rooftop.  The overall scene suggests a secret or a warning about something dangerous.
