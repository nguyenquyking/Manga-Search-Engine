Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, possessed by Liebe, his anti-magic devil. Asta, with a surprised expression, is being carried by Liebe, who is wielding a katana and has a demonic appearance with horns and wings.  The background shows a prison-like structure with numerous skulls. Text bubbles indicate Asta's frustration with their frequent failures (90% of the time) and Liebe's insistence on fighting seriously.  The scene highlights the symbiotic yet strained relationship between Asta and Liebe.
