A manga panel depicting a dark scene where a gate to the underworld opens.  A character, possibly a villain, with dark hair and a mask observes, expressing uncertainty about the gate's opening ("I don't know how it's being done..."). Another character, Morris, is shown within a magical circle, seemingly acting as a catalyst for the gate's opening ("...But is Morris acting as an accelerant for the gate?!"). The final panel shows the masked character resolutely stating, "We have to eliminate him," indicating a conflict is imminent.  The overall tone is ominous and suggests a significant plot development.
