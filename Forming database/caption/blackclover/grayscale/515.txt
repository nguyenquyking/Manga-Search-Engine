Black Clover manga panel depicting a tense confrontation.  Jack, a character with blond hair and a large white feathered collar, is sternly addressing another character (unseen except for their angry face and dark hair).  The unseen character expresses frustration, stating their actions are unrelated to others.  A third character, with short blond hair and a distinctive cross-shaped marking on their nose, is shown separately, implying they are also involved in the conflict. The scene suggests a disagreement over a rescue mission and plans to invade the Spade Kingdom. The overall mood is one of conflict and tension.
