Black Clover manga scene: A fast-moving character, possibly Asta, blurs across the panel, leaving a trail.  He is followed by three characters, possibly Noelle, Mimosa, and another female character, reacting with surprise and alarm.  The speed of the first character is emphasized by motion lines and text indicating "He's much too fast!!"  The scene depicts a high-speed action sequence in a flowering field.
