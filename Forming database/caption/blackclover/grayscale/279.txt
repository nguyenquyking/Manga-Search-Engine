Panel 3: A conversation unfolds between two characters, one appearing concerned for an elderly woman's mental state ("The old lady's gone senile!!").  Another character, Nathan, is addressed. Panel 4: A man in a top hat speaks to another man, presumably his father. Panel 5:  Three characters, including Nathan and the blonde woman from earlier, are seated at a table, seemingly in a somber meeting.
