Black Clover manga scene depicting a powerful demonic entity attacking multiple individuals.  A woman, seemingly the invoker of the ritual, witnesses the chaos with wide, fearful eyes and sweat dripping from her brow.  The demon's dark magic manifests as shadowy tendrils engulfing several people, causing them pain and suffering as evidenced by their pained expressions and sound effects. The text indicates the ritual intended to suppress the demon's power is failing, and the demon is attacking everyone except the invoker.  The woman is shown paralyzed by fear, unable to move.
