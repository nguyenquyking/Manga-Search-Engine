Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  The upper panel shows a close-up of two characters' faces.  One, the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn, smirks confidently, while the other, whose identity is not explicitly stated, is shown with a more neutral expression.  The dialogue indicates a power imbalance. The lower panel depicts a battle scene, likely involving the same characters, with a powerful dark figure with wings unleashing an attack against a smaller figure who appears to be using magic to defend.  The scene suggests overwhelming power against a determined but outmatched opponent.
