Black Clover manga panel depicting Vanica, seemingly injured and on the ground, amidst a dark, swirling magical effect labeled "ZWAASH".  Another character, possibly Asta (though not explicitly named), observes the scene, commenting on the power and ineffectuality of the magic. Vanica is described as "intriguing" by the observer, who adds "However..." implying a change in tactics. The panel showcases a dramatic action sequence involving dark magic and intense expressions from both characters.
