Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a female character (likely Noelle Silva). Asta, in the lower panel, is shown channeling magic, surrounded by glowing particles and a dynamic visual effect suggesting powerful energy release.  Asta's expression is determined. In the upper panel, Noelle is happily confirming that she is ready to support Asta. Text bubbles indicate Asta is charging up, and Noelle acknowledges his actions, stating they need more than star magic to win. The overall scene conveys a sense of urgency and teamwork during a battle.
