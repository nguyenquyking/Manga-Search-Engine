Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta confronting a monstrous, slimy creature.  Asta, visibly angry, is shown close-up. The creature, filling most of the panel, is described as slimy and speaks of engulfing Asta's companions if he takes too long.  The creature's magic is powerful, resisting previous attacks. The only exit is on the top floor.
