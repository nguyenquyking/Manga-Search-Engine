A Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between Damnatio Kira and a Black Bull member (likely Asta or a similar character with spiky hair). Damnatio, holding scales of justice, contemplates the consequences of letting the Black Bulls' actions go unpunished, which involves the Devil-possessed boy and the interruption of a trial.  The Black Bulls' actions, however, are deemed beneficial to the kingdom. The scene highlights Damnatio's burden of responsibility and the weighing of justice against the greater good.  The panel shows multiple perspectives within the same scene: Damnatio's internal conflict, a courtroom scene, and the Black Bulls' perspective on the situation.
