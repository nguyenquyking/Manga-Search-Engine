Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dramatic battle scene unfolds between two characters.  One, a powerful figure clad in dark robes wielding dark energy, commands the other to "Move it!" and "Out of my way!". The second character, seemingly a younger, less experienced fighter, is shown launching a fierce attack, defying the first character's commands with the statement, "I can't just let a peasant kid show me up like that!!!". The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and energy blasts, indicating a high-stakes confrontation.  The overall style is characteristic of a shonen manga battle sequence.
