A large monstrous hand with sharp claws emerges from a cracked, icy surface.  The hand is depicted with impactful motion lines suggesting powerful movement.  In a separate panel, Lotus and another character (unidentified) observe the scene. Lotus expresses concern, stating "Isn't that right, Lotus?".  The unidentified character agrees, commenting  "Yeah...", and  "This is, uh...".  Another panel shows a character (presumably the monster) stating "It's all going perfectly.", creating irony with the other characters' observations. The overall tone suggests a disastrous or dangerous situation.
