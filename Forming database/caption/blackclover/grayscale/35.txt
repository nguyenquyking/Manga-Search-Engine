A dark, shadowy figure, possibly a monster or creature, dominates the scene.  It has long, flowing hair-like appendages and multiple, spindly limbs. The figure is depicted in a distressed, possibly dying state, as indicated by the text "KILL ME!!!" above it.  In the background, flames are visible, suggesting a destructive event.  The text "Lumiere, please" is seen above the flames, indicating a plea to someone named Lumiere for assistance or intervention. The overall visual style is dark and dramatic, typical of a manga or graphic novel.
