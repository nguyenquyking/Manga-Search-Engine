Text indicates their numbers are increasing.  In a separate panel, Asta and a companion react with fear as a powerful, swirling, dark energy erupts nearby. Another character, seemingly a mage in dark attire, is shown reacting to the energy, possibly wielding magic.  Other characters are running away from this dark energy. The overall scene conveys a sense of overwhelming threat and imminent danger.
