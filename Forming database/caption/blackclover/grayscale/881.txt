One Piece manga panel depicting a tense confrontation. A shadowy figure, possibly a villain, is speaking to another character, who appears to be smaller and less powerful.  The shadowy figure is using dark energy, indicated by the "Krik" sound effects and sharp, dark lines emanating from its form.  The smaller character is seemingly defiant, possibly the protagonist. The dialogue boxes reveal the larger figure's frustration ("Man, just shut up") and the smaller figure's resolve ("I don't hate stubborn guys..."). The scene's mood is dark and dramatic, highlighting a power imbalance and a clash of wills.  The visual style is consistent with One Piece's action-oriented aesthetic.
