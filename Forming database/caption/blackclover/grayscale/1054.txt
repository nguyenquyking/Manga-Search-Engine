A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A dark-cloaked figure attacks a powerful, horned entity, whose attack is labeled "Pointless." The attack is ineffective.  In the next panel, a crumbling landscape shows the destructive force of the horned entity.  A close-up shows a character, likely a captain, in awe and fear, commenting on the entity's overwhelming power, emphasizing that even multiple captains cannot touch him.  The scene highlights the immense power disparity between the characters.
