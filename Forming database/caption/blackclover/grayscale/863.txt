Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A scornful, laughing character (likely a villain) dismisses another character (possibly Asta) as a "grotesque creature" and a "peasant," highlighting his own perceived superiority.  Asta, shown in a separate panel, is described as a commoner with incredible instincts, further emphasizing the contrast. The villain's speech bubbles are filled with anger and derision, while Asta's panel provides narrative context about his strength.  A smaller panel shows a visual representation of magical abilities.
