A Black Clover manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  A character, possibly a demon or dark magic user with sharp teeth and horns, is shown in a close-up, their expression menacing.  They are unleashing a powerful attack, depicted by sharp, radiating lines and onomatopoeia "SHNK" and "THOOM".  The character threatens, "I'm not gonna forgive you if you let this end fast!!" and demands, "You'd better show me a good time!!".  The scene is dynamic and suggests a high-stakes confrontation.
