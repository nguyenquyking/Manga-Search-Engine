A grayscale manga panel depicts a character in "Devil Union Mode: Gallus." The character, cloaked in a long, dark robe with large, feathered wings resembling a raven or crow, wears a top hat and a long beak-like mask. Their hands are clawed, and they appear to be floating or descending.  The overall aesthetic is dark and ominous.  No other characters are present.
