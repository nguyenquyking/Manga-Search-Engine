A Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene in two parts.  The first shows three individuals, likely Black Bulls members, in a room discussing training.  The second shows Asta and another Black Bull member, likely a female, in a forest.  Asta is explaining his shadow magic ability, which allows him to move between shadows.  The other Black Bull member is observing. The dialogue boxes detail their conversation about training and Asta's unique magic.  The overall scene suggests a training montage or a mission briefing.
