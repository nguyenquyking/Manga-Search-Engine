Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and an unnamed character. Asta, wearing his signature dark clothing with distinctive markings, boasts about a complex spell he created in half a year, stating it's a one-time-use spell requiring his unique magic.  The unnamed character remarks that it isn't that complicated. A diagram shows how they combined their magic (501 each) to create a spell with 1000 units of magic.  A chain is shown breaking, possibly representing the spell's activation. The scene shows a close-up of the two characters' faces and bodies, with emphasis on Asta's confident expression.
