Manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  A long-haired female character expresses hope for a new morning, noting that the two male characters present are good people, contrasting one with a previous individual. One male character, with devil-like wings, is shown transforming, emphasizing urgency due to a time constraint related to maintaining a "Devil Union" for only five minutes. Another male character reacts with surprise ("OH!").  A final panel shows two additional figures emitting energy.  The overall tone is urgent and dramatic.
