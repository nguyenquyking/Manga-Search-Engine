Asta, in his devil Union form, confronts a bloodied, seemingly defeated,  Black Clover character (possibly a higher-ranking Dark Triad member or a powerful demon). Asta's devil Union form is highlighted by sharp, demonic features and dark energy. The scene is chaotic, filled with black energy bursts and scratch marks suggesting intense combat.  The other character appears wounded and possibly incapacitated. The overall visual style is characteristic of  *Black Clover* manga.
