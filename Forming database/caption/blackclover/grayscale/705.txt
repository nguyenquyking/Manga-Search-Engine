A manga panel depicting a confrontation. A figure with a horned helmet (possibly a devil fruit user or a unique character design) is being kicked by a larger, darker figure whose face is obscured by shadows and whose outfit suggests a powerful warrior or captain.  The larger figure states, "I'm talking with the captain over there," indicating a conversation is occurring with another, unseen individual.  The smaller figure asks, "Do you mind?".  The scene is dynamic, with impactful action lines suggesting a forceful kick.  The overall style is dark and intense, typical of action-oriented manga.
