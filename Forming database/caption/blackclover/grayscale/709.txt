A manga panel depicting a confrontation. A large, menacing bear-like creature dominates the central panel, emanating steam or smoke.  A male character, possibly a swordsman, is positioned below the creature, poised to attack with a blade.  Another male character, possibly an observer or companion, is visible in a smaller panel to the left, observing the scene. The text reads, "IT'S FINE. I CAN SLASH THROUGH THAT."  The scene suggests a battle against a powerful, beast-like opponent in a wooded area.  Leaves are falling, adding to the atmospheric detail.
