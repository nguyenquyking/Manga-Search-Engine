Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta using anti-magic, reacting to Liebe's disappearance.  Asta, with his anti-magic engulfing him, looks surprised and concerned.  In the background, a shadowy figure (possibly a manifestation of his devil) is partially visible.  Another panel shows Asta with a close-up of his face, emphasizing his shocked expression.  Text bubbles indicate "Huh?", "Hm?", and "Liebe's gone!".
