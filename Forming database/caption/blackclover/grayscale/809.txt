Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A black and white manga panel depicts a dramatic scene. A creature, possibly a demon or monster, with pale skin, horns, and a grotesque face, has its arm severed.  Another character, partially visible, reacts with surprise, saying "Hey...". The severed arm is shown flying away, accompanied by motion lines indicating speed and force.  The creature exclaims "What's this?" and "It's severed?" while observing its detached limb. A speech bubble states "If anything could...".  The overall tone suggests shock, violence, and perhaps supernatural elements.
