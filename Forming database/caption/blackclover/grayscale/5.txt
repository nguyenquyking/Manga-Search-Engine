A demonic-looking figure, possibly a Black Clover character (due to the art style), is shown reading a grimoire. He comments on the "marked nuisance" status of another character, off-panel, and finds it "very nice". He then states that he will now use the grimoire he acquired.  Another character, a blonde woman with a flower-like motif, is shown reacting, possibly to the demon's actions.  The overall scene depicts a moment of magical power acquisition and anticipation of conflict.  The Japanese text suggests incantations or the effects of magic.
