A powerful, horned figure, possibly a devil or demonic entity, is shown in a three-panel manga sequence.  Panel one depicts a close-up of the character's face and long, white hair, with a hand obscuring part of the face.  Panel two shows the character unleashing a powerful attack, resulting in a large explosion labeled "GRUNCH."  Panel three shows the aftermath of the attack, with a monstrous, dragon-like creature emerging from the explosion, accompanied by the sound effect "KHOOO." The overall scene depicts a fierce battle and the release of immense power.
