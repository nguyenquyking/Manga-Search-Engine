Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A manga panel depicts a conversation between several characters.  One character, with dark hair, states that "That's reality. Not everyone who's right is necessarily rewarded for it," expressing a cynical viewpoint. Another character, a blonde woman, vehemently disagrees, shouting "NO!!".  A third character, a shorter blonde man, looks on, seemingly surprised.  A fourth character, also dark-haired, stands amidst shadowy, tentacled figures, suggesting a magical or supernatural element to the setting.  Ancient-looking text, possibly magical incantations, are prominently featured in the lower panel.  The scene is tense and dramatic.
