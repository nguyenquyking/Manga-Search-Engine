Black Clover manga scene depicting the All-Knowing Priestess, guardian deity of the Peaceful, Beautiful Heart Kingdom, expressing concern about a character (likely Asta) being affected by a devil's curse.  Asta, along with another character (possibly a female companion), is shown reacting to a powerful magical force or attack. The Priestess holds a book; Asta displays surprise and slight injury.  The scene showcases a contrast between the serene Priestess and the dynamic action surrounding Asta.
