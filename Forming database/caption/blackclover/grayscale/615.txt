One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters. A smaller, panda-like creature with spiky hair is speaking to a larger, shadowy figure. The smaller creature reveals it planned to take over the larger figure's body to fight, but the larger figure expresses surprise and confusion, stating it never fought outside before.  The smaller creature admits it didn't understand the contract. The scene ends with the larger figure disappearing in a burst of darkness, leaving only a silhouette.  The dialogue suggests a power struggle and unexpected outcome.
