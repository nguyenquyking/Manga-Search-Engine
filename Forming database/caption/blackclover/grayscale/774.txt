Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation in a gothic cathedral.  Multiple winged devil-like figures are suspended in mid-air.  Two prominent female devils, with elongated limbs and demonic features, are engaged in a close-up interaction in the lower panel. One states, "How amusing," and the other, "He froze us for a moment."  A third character, unseen but implied, is referenced as having transported them ("He transported us."). A separate devil declares "I'll be your opponent, devils."  The overall scene is dark and dramatic, set within the imposing architecture of a church.
