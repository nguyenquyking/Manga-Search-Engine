A Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle.  A horned, dark-cloaked figure with a crown, likely a high-ranking demon, laughs maniacally, asking his opponent to keep him entertained until a gate opens.  The opponent, seemingly a human character in dark clothing, is shown falling, having been defeated.  Another human character, possibly a subordinate, observes the scene, noting that he needs to get Jack (presumably another character) to attack.  The overall scene is dark and intense, highlighting the power disparity between the demon and the human characters.
