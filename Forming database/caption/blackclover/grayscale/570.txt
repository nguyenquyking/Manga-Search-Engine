A Black Clover manga panel depicts a scene where Asta and another character, possibly a superior, are observing a devil-binding ritual.  The ritual is depicted on a stone altar featuring a chained demonic entity with large wings, surrounded by figures in hooded robes.  Numerous skulls are visible on the altar and in a nearby structure, representing past failed attempts. Asta is visibly concerned, expressing disbelief at the forbidden magic being used. The other character appears apprehensive, acknowledging the forbidden nature of the ritual.  The overall mood is tense and ominous.
