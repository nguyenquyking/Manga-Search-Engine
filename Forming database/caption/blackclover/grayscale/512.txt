A second panel shows a character's worried reaction and the internal monologue, "I haven't managed to tell him I love him yet!!"  A third panel shows two male characters discussing Yami's situation. One says, "Now there's a funny story!", while the other responds,  "Not only that, but... he wasn't even serious yet!!"  The second male character also notes the Dark Triad members' superior power compared to Brigade Captains. The final panel indicates a fierce battle ("We fought with everything we had").  The overall scene conveys concern and the gravity of Yami's situation.
