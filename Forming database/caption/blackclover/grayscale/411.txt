A manga panel depicting a scene where a cursed water spirit disintegrates into dark, swirling clouds, marked by multiple "ZT" sound effects.  A woman with long dark hair, possibly named Dine, witnesses this, exhibiting a horrified expression and bloody tears.  Another character, seemingly a sorceress or practitioner of magic, observes the event, commenting that she's never cursed a water spirit before and that the event served as a good experiment. The overall mood is dark and ominous.
