Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, surprised by another character's statement. Asta is shown in two panels, first reacting to the statement "You'd be able to do it," and then reacting to "Someone like the prince."  The second character is not clearly visible, but is implied to be a significant figure. The third panel shows Asta seemingly fighting a large, monstrous creature with sharp, spiky features.  Asta is engaged in combat, indicated by action lines and onomatopoeia. The scene suggests a high-stakes confrontation.
