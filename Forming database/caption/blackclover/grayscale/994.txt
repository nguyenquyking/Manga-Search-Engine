Black Clover manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  A blond-haired character, possibly Asta, is falling rapidly, surrounded by shattered debris.  He comments, "Oh, is that right? And back down!!!" Another character, seemingly a dark-clad antagonist with horns, is engaged in combat,  impaled by multiple dark projectiles.  A third character, in a dark suit and glasses, is also shown mid-air, possibly launching the projectiles, stating "We belong..."  The antagonist appears wounded, and the overall scene is chaotic and violent, with motion lines and impact effects emphasized. The blond characterâ€™s expression conveys surprise or resignation.
