A powerful, dark vortex engulfs a battlefield in a One Piece manga panel.  A character, possibly Zoro, is shown partially obscured within the vortex's destructive force.  Another character, with long dark hair and holding a book, observes the immense swirling energy from a distance. The scene is characterized by dynamic lines illustrating the vortex's destructive power and the characters' reactions to the intense energy. The panel suggests a climactic moment of a battle involving powerful abilities.
