A manga panel depicting the start of a "hellish game of tag" within a "Dark Prison Hunting Ground"  designated as a "Mana Zone." Two winged, vaguely humanoid figures are shown amidst a chaotic swarm of dark, tentacled entities.  A close-up of an individual, seemingly a participant, with dark hair, intense eyes, and a mask covering their lower face, declares the game's commencement.
