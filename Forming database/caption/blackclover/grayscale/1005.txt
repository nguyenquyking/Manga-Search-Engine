A manga panel depicting a character, possibly Allen, unleashing a powerful fire attack. The character is shown mid-action, with flames erupting from their hands.  Text bubbles indicate the character's determination to kill a devil, even at the risk of widespread damage to a nearby kingdom and town.  A smaller panel shows a child's hopeful expression, contrasting with the grim determination of the main character and the threat of destruction shown in another panel featuring a town under attack.  The overall scene is one of high stakes, with a desperate attempt to defeat a powerful enemy.
