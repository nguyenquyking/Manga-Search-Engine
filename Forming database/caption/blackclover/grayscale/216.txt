The first shows three children reacting to a newspaper article featuring Asta, one child exclaiming "Asta's so cool!", while a nun expresses shock and alarm, mentioning "treason" and a "devil user". The second panel showcases a city in ruins. The third panel shows a gleeful woman and a masked man laughing at the newspaper article about Asta becoming a criminal, the man mockingly calling him a "lousy peasant brat".  The woman expresses amusement at Asta's "pathetic" situation.  Another character, a girl with glasses, excitedly anticipates dissecting Asta.
