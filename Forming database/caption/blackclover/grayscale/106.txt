Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene of chaos and impending danger.  Nozel and Mimosa are shown, with Nozel urgently ordering Mimosa and others to evacuate.  A massive, swirling mass of dark, spiky magical energy is rapidly expanding, threatening to engulf them. The text indicates this is "inhuman magic".  Mimosa appears frightened, while Nozel displays a serious expression. The overall visual suggests an intense magical battle or a natural disaster-like magical event.
