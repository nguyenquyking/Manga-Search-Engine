Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  A young woman with short hair expresses shock while holding a grimoire with a five-leaf clover.  A small, injured devil-like child sits on a bed; a taller, blonde woman with short hair scoffs at the child's apparent frailty while a snake is visible near her.  The dialogue boxes indicate conversations about the grimoire, the devil, and the woman's skepticism of the child's threat.  Key elements include the grimoire, the devil child, the two women, and the snake.
