A manga panel depicts a scene with two characters: a monstrous, grinning creature (likely Megicula's manifestation) and Noelle Silva, a young woman with a crown. Noelle appears shocked, possibly experiencing the effects of Megicula's magic.  The background shows a tranquil countryside scene with buildings, indicating a location outside a major city.  The text bubbles reveal Noelle's past actions (sneaking out to test the devil's power) and her current reaction to Megicula's possession.  The overall scene suggests a moment of intense magical power and a character's internal conflict.
