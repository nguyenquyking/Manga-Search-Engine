Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene with two female characters. One, with a flower-adorned hat, is smiling mischievously and states, "I made that. It's the boy who's on your mind."  The other female character reacts with shock and disbelief, exclaiming about the boy not being on her mind. The first character then points out that this is the perfect place for secret chats, suggesting a hidden motive.  The scene is dynamic, with motion lines suggesting a sudden action or event. A smaller panel shows a third character reacting to the conversation.
