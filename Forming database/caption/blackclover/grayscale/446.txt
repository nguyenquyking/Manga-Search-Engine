A Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta's struggle against a powerful opponent.  Asta, bloodied and visibly strained, declares he cannot defeat the enemy alone. The opponent is a large, dark, shadowy figure with multiple arms, seemingly indestructible as indicated by the text "He doesn't die." Asta's companion is seen observing the battle in the background.  The scene is filled with dark tones and motion lines emphasizing the intensity of the fight.  The text bubbles convey Asta's internal monologue and commentary on his opponent's strength.
