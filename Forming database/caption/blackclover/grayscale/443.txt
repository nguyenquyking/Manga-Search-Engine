A powerful, monstrous figure with sharp teeth and a single eye dominates the panel, declaring the world unequal and unfair, yet vowing not to die.  The creature is surrounded by dark, swirling energy emanating from a large, dark void.  Text boxes explain its overwhelming power, rendering any opponent incapable of victory. Below, a smaller figure is shown seemingly fighting against a powerful force, emphasizing the immense power disparity.  The narrative suggests a nearly impossible feat is required to defeat the monster.
