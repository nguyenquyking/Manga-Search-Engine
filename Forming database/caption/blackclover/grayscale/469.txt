A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, shadowy figure with horns and a circular marking on its chest, possibly a Devil Fruit user, engages in combat with a smaller, seemingly human-sized figure. The smaller figure is seen from below, appearing to be attacked or restrained.  A large sword or blade is partially visible in a separate panel, suggesting an impending attack.  A third panel shows a large, eye-like circular symbol, possibly representing a power or ability.  Characters are not explicitly named.  The scene is high-contrast, emphasizing darkness and shadow.
