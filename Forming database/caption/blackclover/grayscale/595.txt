A Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta furiously battling devils.  Asta, enraged, unleashes a powerful attack, depicted by swirling energy and motion lines.  He faces multiple devil-like opponents, one of which is clearly visible in the central panel. Asta's determination is emphasized through his dialogue ("There's no way this rage could lose to anything!!") and the visual intensity of his attack.  Another panel shows Asta, possibly injured, breathing heavily ("PHOOO"). The overall scene conveys a brutal and intense fight against multiple enemies.
