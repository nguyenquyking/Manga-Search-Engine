Black Clover manga panel depicting Finral teleporting.  Finral uses his teleportation magic ("Instant Teleportation"), described as highly agile and accurate, to move directly to Langris.  The scene highlights the power of Finral's magic, even within Zenon's Absolute Space, due to Langris's mana zone.  The panel shows Finral's spell in action, with a geometric representation of the teleportation effect.  Another character, seemingly Langris, is visible in a separate panel, ready for action.
