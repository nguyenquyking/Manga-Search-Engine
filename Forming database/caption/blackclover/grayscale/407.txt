Manga panel depicting a powerful magic attack.  A female character, possibly a sorceress, unleashes a dark, spiky energy blast, indicated by large "BLOOSH" and other impact sound effects.  Another female character, Lolo Peshka, is shown reacting with fear and surprise to the attack, which is described as "hideous magic".  The attack appears to be widespread and destructive, with many smaller, spiky energy streams radiating outward. The scene is highly dynamic, emphasizing the intensity of the magical attack.
