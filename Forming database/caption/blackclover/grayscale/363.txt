One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  A woman in glasses is impressed, commenting on a character's strength, willpower, and hard work, noting the surprising aspect of them being an Arcane Stage.  A separate scene shows a group of people being directed, likely for evacuation or processing.  A soldier-like figure instructs "Next group! Go on in." and "Take the folks on the ground to the back," indicating an organized movement of people.  A large, powerful energy wave is shown in the middle panel, potentially related to the previously mentioned character's strength.  The overall scene suggests a post-event situation where people are being managed.
