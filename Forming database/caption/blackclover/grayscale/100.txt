Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, with angry expression, witnessing a dark, destructive force engulfing what appears to be a subterranean structure.  Two smaller figures, possibly allies, are seen fleeing the encroaching darkness in the upper panel.  The lower panel shows large, swirling, dark tendrils emanating from the abyss, suggesting a powerful, possibly magical, attack.  The scene is chaotic and conveys a sense of impending doom.  Text bubbles in the Japanese language are present but not translatable in this context.
