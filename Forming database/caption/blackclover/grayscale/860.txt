Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A horned, dark-clothed antagonist with a regenerating body (likely a devil or demon) boasts about his regenerative abilities ("...as long as I can regenerate with body magic...") while a light-colored haired character (likely an opposing magic knight) looks on in grim determination.  The antagonist laughs maniacally ("heh heh heh..."), blood splatters ("Splutch") are visible, suggesting ongoing combat,  and the antagonist's body shows signs of damage but is rapidly healing. The text indicates the antagonist's confidence in his invulnerability.
