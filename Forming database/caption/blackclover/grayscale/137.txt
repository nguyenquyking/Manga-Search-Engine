Black Clover manga panel depicting Yami Sukehiro's "Prickly Queen Version 2.0" attack.  Charla and a man with spiky hair (likely Asta) observe as a large, spherical structure composed of brick-like material is violently crushed by four large, column-like structures.  Onomatopoeia words like "OOM," "TH," and "GRUNCH" illustrate the destructive force.
