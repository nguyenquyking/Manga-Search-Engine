Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, possessed by Liebe, confronting a shadowy figure. Asta, in a demonic form, is chained.  He shows a surprised expression, while a speech bubble above him reads "Be my friend!!!".  A second panel shows a close-up of Asta's demonic face, with the word "Huh?" below. A third panel shows a calm-looking character, possibly an antagonist, observing the scene.  The scene is high-contrast, black and white, typical of the manga's style.
