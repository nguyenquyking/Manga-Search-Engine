Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga panel suitable for vector embedding:  A character, seemingly trapped within a translucent, cubic subspace, is shown.  The character appears to be wearing a hooded cloak with wings.  Another character, outside the cube, uses "Star Magic: Conjunction,"  manifesting a bright burst of energy, seemingly to affect the trapped individual.  The text indicates the trapped character has no way to escape the subspace.
