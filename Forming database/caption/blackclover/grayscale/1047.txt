Black Clover manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A large, shadowy figure with horns dominates the upper half, possibly a demon or powerful antagonist.  A smaller figure, possibly Asta, is shown below, seemingly impacted by an attack, surrounded by an energy burst. Text overlays read "Con-", "stars are born.", and "junction".  A smaller panel at the bottom shows a series of smaller panels from the manga, potentially showing Asta's past or a previous fight. Speech bubbles indicate dialogue: "...WE..." and "...YOU MEAN...". The overall visual style suggests a pivotal moment of intense power and transformation.
