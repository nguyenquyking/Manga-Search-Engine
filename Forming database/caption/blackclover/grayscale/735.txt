Black Clover manga panel depicting a large, snow-capped mountain in the distance. Two characters, a boy and a girl, are in the foreground. The girl points towards the mountain, exclaiming "LOOK!!". The boy, seemingly surprised, responds with "HEY...".  The scene shows a sense of wonder and discovery.  The bottom panel shows two large, dark, spiraling structures rising from the ground, possibly smoke or magical energy. The overall tone is dramatic and suspenseful.
