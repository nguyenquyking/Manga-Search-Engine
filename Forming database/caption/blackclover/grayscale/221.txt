A manga panel depicts a tense courtroom scene.  A stern-faced judge addresses a dark-haired individual, possibly Asta from Black Clover, who is described as a dangerous element. The judge emphasizes the individualâ€™s actions sow calamity and that there's no escape, even if they defeat him. The implication is that the individual's disappearance would save many magic knights.  The final panel shows a close-up of a woman's face, possibly a witness or a judge's assistant, reacting to the situation. The overall tone is serious and foreboding.
