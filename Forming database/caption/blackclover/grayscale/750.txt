Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, Noelle Silva, and a surprised, spectacled Magic Knight. Asta is shown performing a powerful magic attack, indicated by the speed lines and onomatopoeia ("GOOOOOOOO!!!" and "ASTAAAAAA!!!").  Noelle is seen mid-air, seemingly supporting or witnessing Asta's attack.  The spectacled Magic Knight expresses disbelief and astonishment at Asta's abilities, stating it's due to his exceptional skill as a Magic Knight, rather than demonic possession.  Smaller panels show flashback scenes of Asta's previous battles.
