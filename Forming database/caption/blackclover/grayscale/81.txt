Black Clover manga panel depicting a powerful magic spell.  Licht unleashes a devastating attack, creating a large dark void that consumes debris from a crumbling stone structure. Asta and another character (possibly Yuno) watch in awe and shock.  The spell is described as being in a "whole different league."  A devil's heart is shown in a separate panel.  The scene is chaotic and highlights the immense power of Licht's magic.
