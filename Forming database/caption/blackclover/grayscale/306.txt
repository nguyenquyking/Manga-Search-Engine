Black Clover manga panel depicting a fast-paced battle. Two characters, seemingly female, with short, curly hair are shown mid-flight, using spatial magic. One is slightly ahead, and both are propelled forward by what appears to be a magic-based technique. Another character, male with spiky hair, performs "Fallen Angel's Wingbeat," a spatial magic attack, shown by energy bursts.  The effect is seen as the landscape rapidly shifts and rearranges. A third character, a man with short, dark hair and facial scars, observes the scene, commenting that it's only stage three of the battle.  The overall scene is dynamic and suggests a chaotic, high-stakes confrontation.
