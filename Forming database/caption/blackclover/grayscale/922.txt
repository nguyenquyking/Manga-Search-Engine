One Piece manga panel depicting a magical battle.  A dark, shadowy figure, possibly a sorceror, stands within a swirling, decaying world created by their "Curse-Warding Magic."  The spell's effect is vast, encompassing a large area.  Another character, partially visible, is shown being defeated or repelled by the magic.  The text indicates the overwhelming power and speed of the dark figure's magic, leaving the defeated character speechless. The scene is filled with chaotic energy and dark, stylized lines.
