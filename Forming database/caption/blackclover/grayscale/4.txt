Black Clover manga scene depicting a battle.  Licht, using magic, is observed by two characters. One comments on Licht's surprisingly effective movement despite seemingly not using his full power. The other observes the even balance of the fight but notes a potential shift. A panel shows a power level chart: Devil (highest), Charla, Nozel (Royals), Me, Sol (Nobles), Magna (Commoners), and Kid (lowest).  A character expresses concern about Licht's overwhelmingly powerful magic.  The scene is dynamic, focusing on the intense battle and analysis of the power dynamics between characters.
