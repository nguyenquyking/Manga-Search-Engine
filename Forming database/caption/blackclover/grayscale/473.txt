Black Clover manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  The top panel shows Asta, eyes wide with shock and sweat, witnessing an event.  The bottom panel shows Yami Sukehiro being impaled and lifted into the air by numerous long, bone-like appendages extending from a dark, shadowy figure.  The text "Mister Yami!!!" expresses alarm.  The background is a dark, stormy sky over a mountainous landscape. The overall tone is one of intense action and danger.
