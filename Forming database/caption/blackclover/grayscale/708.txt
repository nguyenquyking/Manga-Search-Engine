A young man recounts a memory from when he was 13.  The panels show him observing a large figure (possibly the "Lord of the Mountain") approaching from a distance, leaving large claw marks.  The text indicates that others expected this encounter due to the man's hunting activities. The scene is set near a body of water and a mountain.  The initial panel depicts a large, bird-like creature.
