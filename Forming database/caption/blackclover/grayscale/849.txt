Black Clover manga panel depicting a powerful dark magic user, likely a devil or high-ranking demon, wielding a magical chain. The top panel shows the character, with horns and a dark crown, manifesting a large, glowing magical chain with a circular symbol at its center.  The lower panels show the chain ensnaring another, smaller, horned figure who reacts with surprise ("What's this?"). The smaller figure is being dragged by the chain.  The overall scene suggests a battle or capture using dark magic.
