Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, possessed by a devil,  and Yami Sukehiro.  Asta, with devil horns and a sinister expression, speaks,  "You'd release me voluntarily!!!"  Yami, in the lower panel, smirks confidently, stating, "...and win."  A speech bubble near Yami says, "You fight the Devil...". The scene suggests a confrontation between Asta, under demonic influence, and Yami.  The background features dark, ominous imagery.
