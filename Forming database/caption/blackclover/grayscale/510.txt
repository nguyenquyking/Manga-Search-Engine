Black Clover manga panel depicting a tense scene in a grand hall.  A group of characters, including Asta, stands before a council or court.  Two prominent figures stand at the far right, possibly high-ranking officials.  Asta, with spiky hair, is centrally positioned, showing a serious expression. Other characters, including younger individuals in royal or noble attire, are present. The word "DAUUM" is prominently displayed above the main group, suggesting dramatic tension or impact.  Close-up panels below feature Asta and another individual, possibly a royal or another significant character, emphasizing their expressions and reactions.  The overall visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga.
