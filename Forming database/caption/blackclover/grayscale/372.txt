A manga panel depicting a scene where a man collapses, seemingly lifeless. A nun witnesses the event, expressing shock and concern.  The man's face is partially obscured, and he appears to be wearing dark clothing. The nun, with dark hair and a nun's habit, is shown reacting to the man's fall.  The background suggests a church or monastery setting.  The text bubbles indicate the nun's observations ("My, it's starting to cloud over...") and the man's apparent final words ("Master... no").  The overall mood is one of sudden tragedy and unexpected death.
