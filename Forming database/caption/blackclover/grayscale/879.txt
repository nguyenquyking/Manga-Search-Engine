A manga panel depicting a monstrous, grotesque figure undergoing a violent transformation, possibly due to magic or a cursed object.  The creature is screaming and emitting dark, splotchy substances.  Sound effects like "splut," "bloorp," and "zluck" emphasize the visceral nature of the transformation.  A book or tome is partially visible near the creature, suggesting a magical or ritualistic context.  Another panel shows a close-up of a horrified face, possibly another character reacting to the transformation. The text implies a sense of disbelief and impending defeat,  with dialogue suggesting the character is unwilling to accept the possibility of losing to such a creature.
