One Piece manga panel depicting a dark magic spell being broken. A dark-haired figure is shown collapsing amidst a shower of dark, splatter-like effects, possibly indicating the dissipation of the spell.  The figure exclaims "Impossible!!" in shock and states that their spell was broken, something that shouldn't be physically possible.  The scene suggests a confrontation between characters with opposing magical abilities, with the dark-haired character being defeated. The use of onomatopoeia ("sploosh", "blorp", "splat") enhances the visual impact of the magical effects.
