A Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta battling multiple shadowy figures.  Asta, with his signature anti-magic grimoire, is shown mid-attack, striking the dark creatures.  The shadowy figures are dark and amorphous, suggesting they are manifestations of dark magic.  Impact sounds ("DAK," "WH," "UD") emphasize the intensity of the fight.  Text indicates that each shadowy figure possesses the same ki as Vice-Captain Nacht.
