A Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a character, seemingly a young woman with multiple eyes and dark markings, expresses surprise ("What?") as the curse runes on her vanish ("The curse runes vanished?").  A bat-like creature with a white, ruffled appearance is shown flying amidst a field of roses in the subsequent panel, implying a connection to the vanishing curse. The overall tone suggests a magical event with uncertain consequences.
