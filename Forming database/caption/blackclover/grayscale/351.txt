Black Clover manga illustration for the 2019 Reader Gift Campaign.  Asta, with a mischievous grin, is prominently featured in the foreground, partially obscured by Yuno. Yuno, wearing a crown-like headpiece, is positioned behind Asta, his expression more serious. Both characters are depicted in dynamic poses, with dark, stylized magical effects surrounding them.  The overall style is dramatic and action-oriented.
