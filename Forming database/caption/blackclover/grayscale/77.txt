Black Clover manga panel depicting intense magical combat.  A powerful light beam erupts, seemingly emanating from a winged figure.  A character with spiky hair, possibly Asta, is shown reacting with shock,  "Licht...!"  Another character, with dark hair, is seen in motion, possibly dodging the attack.  In a subsequent panel, a figure lies incapacitated on the ground, surrounded by rubble, while another character, possibly Yuno, stands in a dark outfit, observing a geometric magic symbol with a concerned-looking girl in a dress nearby. The scene suggests a high-stakes battle with significant magical power displayed.
