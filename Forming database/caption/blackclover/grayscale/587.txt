A manga panel depicting a distraught mother and her demonic son.  The mother, with blood dripping from her mouth, speaks, "My dear son...! Live...Liebe...!"  Her son, characterized by demonic features including horns and dark eyes, is shown in anguish, possibly due to his mother's condition.  In a subsequent panel, the son cries out "Mom!" as he appears to be dissolving or transforming.  The final panel shows a hand reaching for a glowing, possibly magical, object. The scene is emotionally charged and suggests a sacrifice or transformation involving magic.
