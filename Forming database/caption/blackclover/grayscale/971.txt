One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A defeated, reptilian-like creature (possibly Megicula) lies on the ground, while a winged female character with blonde hair (likely an angel or similar being) and a blonde haired male character look on. Text indicates that the humans refused to give up and needed to grow stronger together. The overall scene showcases a victory for the winged characters over the defeated creature.
