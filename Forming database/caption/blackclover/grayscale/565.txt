Asta, in a shocked and angry expression, confronts a significantly larger, demonic-looking figure.  The larger figure, possibly a transformed Asta or an opponent, mocks Asta's height.  Asta's dialogue expresses his refusal to let the larger figure proceed with an unknown action. The scene is set in a dark, gothic-styled location.  The panel displays a flashback of a previous encounter between the two figures.
