A Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, seemingly Asta, is surprised by an attack labeled "Storm of Blades."  The attack involves numerous black blades raining down, seemingly summoned or manipulated by a dark, shadowy figure wielding a large, scythe-like weapon.  Asta's speech bubbles express his astonishment at the sheer scale and power of the magic.  Smaller inset panels show additional views of the attack's destructive power and the caster's ability to manipulate matter.
