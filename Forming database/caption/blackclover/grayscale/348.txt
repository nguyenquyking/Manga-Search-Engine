This One Piece manga page features four characters: Yagasa, Sōta Hishikawa, Seiya Miyamoto, and an unnamed character.  Yagasa is depicted recalling a crowded New Year's train experience. Sōta remembers a childhood incident involving syrup and snow. Seiya is shown getting food poisoning from oysters. The unnamed character is dressed as Santa Claus, carrying a large bag of gifts, and appears to be unrelated to the other narratives.  The page uses a panel layout to separate each character's winter memory.
