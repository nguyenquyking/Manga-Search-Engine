Black Clover manga panel depicting a powerful magic spell.  A horned, dark-clad figure with face markings unleashes a large, dark, energy-based spell, emanating from chains bound to his arms.  Another character, seemingly surprised and strained, observes the spell, commenting on its immense power exceeding his own. The first character's dialogue indicates he devised this spell.  The scene is dynamic, highlighting the contrast in magical power between the two characters.
