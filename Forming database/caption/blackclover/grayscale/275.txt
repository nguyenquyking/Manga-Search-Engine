Black and white manga panel depicting a scene outside a large, gothic-style mansion.  Three figures, seemingly Mister Gordon's relatives, stand before the gate.  The characters are styled in period clothing. Crows are perched on the mansion's roof and surrounding trees.  In a separate panel, Grey, a character with spiky blond hair, is shown rejecting the clingy advances of a smaller, shorter character with reddish hair.  Grey expresses a desire to go home.  The overall mood is somewhat dark and mysterious, enhanced by the gothic architecture and the presence of crows.  The text bubbles reveal the characters' thoughts and dialogue, focusing on the discomfort of meeting ghosts and Grey's desire to leave.
