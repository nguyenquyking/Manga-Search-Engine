Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, his body immobile, and a distressed Rouge. Asta's eyes are wide with shock and despair as he's told his body can't move and that it's his fault.  Rouge, in a panicked state, pleads for help, her grimoire open nearby, and a black cat-like creature is partially visible.  Asta's inability to contract is emphasized. The background suggests a chaotic, possibly magical, event.  The overall tone is one of urgency and desperation.
