A Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A muscular character, possibly Asta, is shown in the top left panel, his arm heavily marked, indicating he's been drained of magic and life energy.  He looks pained and surprised. A smaller panel to the right shows a close-up of his face with a grimace.  Another character is shown fleeing amidst a mass of dark, spiky tendrils in a separate panel.  The lower panels depict the same spiky tendrils, identified as a life-devouring spell, engulfing two other characters, who appear to be struggling against it.  The text indicates the spell is unstoppable and has rendered one character unable to wield a blade.  The overall scene portrays a desperate situation where a powerful spell has overwhelming power.
