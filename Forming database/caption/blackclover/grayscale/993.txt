Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A blond-haired character, likely Asta, is shown being attacked, numerous sharp projectiles piercing his body.  He is wearing a dark, buttoned uniform.  Below, another character, possibly a demon or possessing demonic features, with a skeletal ribcage visible, declares his superiority.  The scene showcases a power differential, with the demon asserting his strength over the injured Asta.  The word "Shunk" appears twice in the upper panel, suggesting impact sounds.
