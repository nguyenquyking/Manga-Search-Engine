Here's a concise description of the One Piece manga panel suitable for vector embedding:  A wide shot depicts a large, gothic-style house, "Twilight Valhalla," under attack. Numerous small winged figures assail the building from the air and ground.  A large, dark, tree-like structure, labeled "Curse Warding Magic: Unbound Slave," emanates from the lower panel, seemingly the source of the attack. The panel also features onomatopoeia, "VWAAAAA" and "WHUD," indicating impact and movement.  The scene is chaotic and depicts a magical battle.
