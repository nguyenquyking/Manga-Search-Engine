Asta, severely injured, is being attacked by dark, tentacled creatures.  He's shown in multiple panels, expressing pain ("Ghk...", "AAAAAH!!").  Another character, possibly Noelle, is seen in the lower panel, seemingly injured and covered in ash ("ASH").  Asta is being helped and is expressing gratitude ("Thank you very m-"). The scene is chaotic and violent, depicting a fierce battle against monstrous beings.
