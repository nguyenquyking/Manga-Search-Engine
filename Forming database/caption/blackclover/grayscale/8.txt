One Piece manga panel depicting a massive, writhing mass of what appears to be sentient, worm-like creatures erupting from the ground.  Two figures, possibly fighters, are shown struggling amidst the creatures. One figure is partially visible and fleeing from the mass. A close-up in the second panel shows a character's shocked face reacting to the scene, with a speech bubble indicating "This thing... is real bad news." The overall scene conveys a sense of overwhelming danger and chaos.
