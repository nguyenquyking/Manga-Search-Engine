Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta's enraged reaction to his comrades being labeled as traitors.  Asta is shown in close-up, his face contorted in anger, with a speech bubble stating, "You guys...!!"  The upper panel shows a group of Black Bulls members, including Asta's fellow squad members, seemingly surrendering or being forced into a subservient role.  They appear distressed and are surrounded by rubble.  The text implies they are being forced to accept any label, even traitor, by an unseen opponent.  The visual style is characteristic of Black Clover's action manga aesthetic, with dynamic lines and expressive character faces.
