Manga panel depicting Asta's attack.  Asta, shown in the bottom right panel, is shouting and launching a powerful attack. The attack, depicted as a massive wave of dark, spiky projectiles, is shown crushing a blonde-haired woman (likely a foe) in the upper panels. The woman looks surprised and is being overwhelmed by the force of the attack.  Onomatopoeia like "SHLO MPF" and "SKASHSKASH" emphasize the impact and speed of Asta's attack. The overall scene depicts a dynamic, intense battle moment.
