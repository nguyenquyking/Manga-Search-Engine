Black Clover manga panel depicting a high-speed battle.  A character (likely Asta) struggles to keep up with a fast-moving opponent, commenting on the opponent's speed and his own inability to catch up. Another character observes that the opponent's current power state is unsustainable.  The opponent is shown in a powerful, dark, possibly demonic form, with large, clawed appendages.  The scene is dynamic, with many speed lines and impact effects. The dialogue reveals a tense situation where one character attempts to restrain the powerful opponent.
