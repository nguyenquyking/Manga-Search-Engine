Black Clover manga panel depicting Noelle Silva.  One panel shows a character pouring tea.  Another shows a wide shot of a rubble-filled area, described as a place where bad people are trapped and punished.  Noelle is shown amazed by a spell's power, while simultaneously enjoying tea and commenting on its deliciousness. The scene contrasts the mundane act of drinking tea with the destructive power of magic.
