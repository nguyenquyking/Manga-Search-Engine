Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A female character, possibly Noelle Silva, is shown in the upper panel declaring, "I'll end this in 30 seconds!!".  The lower panels show a dynamic action sequence with multiple characters engaged in intense combat, with speed lines and impact effects indicating fast-paced movement and powerful attacks.  One character appears to be flying or falling, surrounded by swirling energy.  The overall scene suggests a climactic moment in a fight with high stakes.  Specific character names beyond Noelle cannot be definitively confirmed without further context.  Sound effects such as "WHIRR" and "WHOOSH" enhance the visual dynamism.
