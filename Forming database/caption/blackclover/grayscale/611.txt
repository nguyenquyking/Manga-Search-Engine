Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta's determination.  Asta, with a determined expression, is shown reacting to a figure (likely a demon) and a dark-cloaked individual holding a grimoire.  The dark-cloaked individual is standing next to a large, shadowy, horned creature, possibly a demon. The scene is set against a background of a crumbling building with skulls. Text bubbles convey the message that being right doesn't guarantee reward, and Asta's resolve to get stronger.  The overall mood is serious and intense.
