A multi-headed Hydra of Darkneros, conjured via Devil Water Magic, dominates the scene.  A smaller figure, seemingly a mage, stands amidst the Hydra's heads.  In a separate panel, a female character with dark markings around her eyes speaks, revealing she manipulated a curse, transforming someone into a devil.  Another panel shows a distressed, winged female character, likely the one transformed, questioning what happened to her.  The overall mood is dark and ominous.
