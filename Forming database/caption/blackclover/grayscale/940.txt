Close-up of a determined female character, possibly Noelle Silva from Black Clover, with sweat dripping from her face, shouting,  "...lies in not giving up!!!"  A speech bubble next to her declares, "OUR STRENGTH...". The lower portion of the image shows a partially visible, possibly injured, male character in the background.  The overall scene depicts a moment of intense struggle and resolve.
