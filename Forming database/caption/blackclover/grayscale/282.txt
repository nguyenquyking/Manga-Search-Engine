One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between two characters.  A stern-faced character in a military-style cap, Gordon, refuses to return home. He is being addressed by an older man with a prominent mustache and top hat, who offers to teach him about poisons, curses, and drugs.  The older man emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and the quick death of humans. The scene includes a book, possibly a grimoire, and a jar containing eyeballs, suggesting dark magic and alchemy.
