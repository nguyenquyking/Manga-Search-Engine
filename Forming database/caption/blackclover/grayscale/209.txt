This One Piece manga panel depicts three chibi-style characters, each representing a different culture.  The top left shows "Mexican Charmy" wearing a sombrero, playing maracas, and standing near a cactus.  To the right is an unnamed character in traditional Chinese clothing, performing a stylized pose. Finally, at the bottom is "Indian Charmy" seated in a meditative pose, wearing traditional Indian garb.  Each character is labeled with their respective cultural identifier followed by "Charmy." The art style is simple, using black ink on a textured, off-white background.
