One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Yami Sukehiro (judging by hair and attire), is shown being impacted by a powerful attack, indicated by "slash" sound effects and crystalline fragments.  He is reacting with pain ("GHK...").  The second panel shows him seemingly launched upwards, impacted by a large, dark-colored, possibly stone or earth-based object,  shattering as it impacts the ground ("BAM", "WHOOSH" sound effects). The visual style is consistent with One Piece's dynamic action sequences.
