Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, possibly Asta (unclear due to stylistic choices), deflects or counters a barrage of dark, chained projectiles using a grimoire.  The projectiles are shown in motion with speed lines.  In the upper panel, a smaller figure in dark clothing is visible, possibly the source of the attack.  Another character's face, partially obscured by a mask or similar feature, is seen in the upper right corner, potentially reacting to the attack.  The overall scene is dynamic, showcasing fast-paced action and magical combat.
