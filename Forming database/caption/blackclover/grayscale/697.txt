Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Charlotte Roselei, in her captain's attire, expresses determination to save someone, likely Yami Sukehiro who is partially visible and seems surprised.  A powerful, dark-cloaked figure, possibly a transformed or possessed Charlotte, laughs maniacally, stating they've found the "best opponent ever."  The scene is dynamic, emphasizing the power imbalance and impending conflict.
