Black Clover manga panel depicting a powerful magic attack. Irial Astrauza unleashes "True Lightning Magic," a massive lightning strike that engulfs the landscape.  Another character, unseen but implied to be the target, is incapacitated, stating they "can't move or breathe."  A third character observes, noting the attack's power, and the concept of "stages" in magical ability, with the highest stage being zero.  The scene is rendered in black and white, with dramatic use of onomatopoeia to convey the impact of the magic.
