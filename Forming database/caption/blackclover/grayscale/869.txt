Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  One character, with horns and a sinister grin,  holds a glowing circular symbol and asks "Do you see now?".  The other character, seemingly bound by chains with a similar symbol on their chest, is shown struggling, exclaiming "It's all... pointless!!!" and denouncing the situation as an "unfair, unequal reality." The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and impact sounds.
