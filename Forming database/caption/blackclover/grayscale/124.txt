Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle. Asta, in a dynamic pose, uses his anti-magic sword against a powerful, shadowy demonic entity.  Asta is shown in multiple panels, expressing exertion and determination.  The demonic entity displays sharp teeth and claws, indicating its aggressive nature.  Text bubbles show Asta's opponent reaching their limit, and Asta's allies expressing concern ("What a shame," and "Asta!").  The overall scene is chaotic and high-energy, filled with motion lines indicating speed and force.  The style is characteristic of shonen manga, with dramatic expressions and exaggerated movements.
