Asta,  with spiky blonde hair and a grimace, is overwhelmed by fast and powerful attacks.  A demonic figure, possibly a devil, attacks him with sharp claws.  Asta struggles to defend himself, unable to counter the speed of the attacks using his word magic.  The scene is dynamic and filled with motion lines indicating swift movements.  Another character, possibly Yuno (though not clearly shown), is also partially visible, reacting to the situation. The overall tone is one of intense battle and overwhelming odds.
