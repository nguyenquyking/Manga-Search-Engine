A black and white manga panel depicts a climactic battle.  Two figures are central: Asta, wielding his anti-magic sword, and another character (possibly an enemy)  engaging in a fierce confrontation amidst numerous monstrous, plant-like creatures with gaping maws.  The text bubble repeatedly states "It's over," signifying the impending end of the fight.  Asta's attack is depicted with dynamic motion lines and radiating energy. The scene is chaotic and filled with action, suggesting a final blow being delivered.
