A manga panel depicting a somber scene in the rain.  Two characters, seemingly in a conversation. One is a man in a dark cloak, possibly the main character, expressing his internal conflict and determination to fight evil ("I'll destroy evil with evil from the shadows, until I die"). The other, shown partially, appears to be offering him a position of Vice-Captain, to which the first man reacts negatively, stating he can't be praised or stand in the spotlight.  The setting includes a tombstone or grave, adding to the melancholic atmosphere.  The dialogue reveals a character's self-loathing and resolve to fight despite his internal struggles.
