One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Lady Vani is using her magic, causing a large, screeching energy blast that impacts an unseen opponent.  The impact is depicted with strong visual effects and onomatopoeia ("SCREEE," "BLOOSH," "SLIII").  Another character, possibly an opponent, is shown in the lower panel, seemingly injured and reacting to Vani's attack with a "Doh ho ho ho ho ho!"  The text indicates Vani's magic is praised as "fantastic." The scene is dynamic and emphasizes the power of Vani's magic.
