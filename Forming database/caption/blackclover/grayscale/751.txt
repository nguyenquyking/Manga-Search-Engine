Asta, in his devil-union form, with large black devil wings, is shown powerfully attacking a monstrous, shadowy creature.  The creature has a gaping maw and sharp features.  Asta's expression is fierce.  Yuno, with a worried expression, observes the battle from a distance.  Text boxes describe Asta's attack as primitive but effective, and the monster as an enormous mass of supercharged magic.
