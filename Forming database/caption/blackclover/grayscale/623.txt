Manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A Black Clover character, Asta, stands in the background facing several large, swirling vortexes.  In the foreground, another Black Clover character, seemingly Yami Sukehiro, is sweating profusely and looking intensely at the vortexes and Asta. A third character, possibly a subordinate, is shown partially in the bottom panel, also seemingly reacting to the scene.  Yami questions why Asta is hiding. The overall scene suggests a powerful magical event is taking place.
