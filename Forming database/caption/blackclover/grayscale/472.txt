Close-up of two characters, seemingly in tense confrontation.  The character on the left has dark, spiky hair, a facial scar, and what appears to be a small horn or similar appendage. He has a serious expression. The character on the right has similarly dark, but longer and less spiky hair. His expression is one of concern or apprehension; he appears to be sweating.  The word "ZIT" (likely an onomatopoeia for a sound or impact) is depicted in large, stylized lettering between them. The bottom panel shows a close-up of an eye, possibly belonging to a third, unseen character, suggesting observation or anticipation of the interaction above.  No specific names are identifiable from the visual alone.
