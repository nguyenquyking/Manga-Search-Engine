Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dramatic Black Clover manga panel depicts a scene of intense magical energy.  A character, possibly Asta (in a dark, winged form), is surrounded by powerful, radiating energy blasts, depicted by sharp, white lines. Another figure, smaller and seemingly falling, is amidst the chaos.  The scene is filled with onomatopoeia representing the energyâ€™s force ("KRAKL," "KRIK," "AAAA"). The final panel reads "...I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF," indicating remorse or regret from a character within the scene. The overall visual style suggests a climactic moment of battle or magical conflict.
