A manga panel depicts a chaotic scene.  A woman with light hair, possibly a sorceress, looks down in surprise ("??!" speech bubble).  Below, another woman, possibly a smaller character falling, is shown mid-air amidst a flurry of floating objects: furniture, pastries, and other items.  The smaller woman shows motion lines and expresses shock ("EEK!" speech bubble). The larger woman expresses surprise ("Huh ?!" speech bubble) at the chaotic situation. The overall scene suggests a magical or fantastical event causing objects to float in disarray.
