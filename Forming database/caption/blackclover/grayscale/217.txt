One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Valtos, a blonde character with spiky hair, is angrily berating another character with dark hair and glasses, who is seemingly unconcerned.  A third character, with longer dark hair, is actively attacking Valtos and the dark-haired character, slicing through a stone wall.  The dark-haired attacker is described as a "criminally visaged insect" by one of the victims. The scene takes place in a city with European-style architecture visible in the background.  The overall tone is action-packed and confrontational.
