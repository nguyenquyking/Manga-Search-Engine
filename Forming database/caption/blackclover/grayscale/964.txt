A manga panel depicting a scene with Nozel.  A woman, presumably Nozel's mother, lies on a bed, smiling weakly at Nozel.  Nozel is standing beside the bed, appearing distraught.  The mother encourages Nozel to live and become stronger than her.  The text indicates that the mother died a year after being stricken with a curse, and Nozel helplessly watched.  The panel showcases a tender but heartbreaking moment between mother and child, focusing on themes of strength, loss, and legacy.
