Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between Asta (surprised expression, identifiable by his spiky hair and grimace), and another character (dark hair, serious expression).  The dialogue reveals that the other character was evacuated to the Clover Kingdom during a rebellion against the royal family.  A third character, possibly a superior, expresses concern about a servant of the old Spade royal family possibly being a hostile spy. The scene emphasizes suspicion and strategic planning.
