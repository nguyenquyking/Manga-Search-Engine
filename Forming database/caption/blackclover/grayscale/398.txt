Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Lolopechka, visibly strained but determined, confronts an opponent whose face is partially obscured, but is revealed to be Lady Vanica who is partially controlling Lolopechka with a spell.  Lolopechka states her motivations are revenge for her mother and for the sake of the world.  Another character, possibly an ally, comments on Lolopechka's incredible strength.  A separate panel shows a bystander observing the scene, commenting on Lolopechka's apparent modesty.  The overall tone is intense and action-oriented, focusing on Lolopechka's strength and resolve in a high-stakes battle.
