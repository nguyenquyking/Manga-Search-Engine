A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, seemingly male, with spiky dark hair and ornate clothing featuring a large circular emblem on his chest, observes a powerful attack. The attack is represented by a large, swirling, striped creature resembling a dragon, roaring and emanating a powerful shockwave across the landscape. The character appears relieved or impressed, commenting on the attacker's skill in modulating the force of the attack.  The scene suggests a significant power differential and the character's skill in defensive techniques.  Smaller panels show the character's reaction and additional text describing the scene.
