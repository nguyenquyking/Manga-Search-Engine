A manga panel depicts a magical duel.  Two robed figures are engaged in a confrontation. One figure, seemingly older with a concerned expression, observes as their magic, depicted as shrinking flames, is countered. The other figure, cloaked and hooded, actively manipulates their magic, causing the opposing magic to diminish.  The scene includes a pair of scales in a previous panel suggesting a balance of power.  Sound effects like "TAP," "CLINK," and "FLAP" emphasize the actions. The text indicates that one mage's magic is shrinking.
