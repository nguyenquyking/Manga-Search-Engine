Close-up of a character's face, possibly Asta from Black Clover,  with blood splatter on his face. He is expressing a knowing smirk.  Speech bubbles indicate he's thinking, "It wasn't...you," and "I knew...". The scene is monochromatic, emphasizing the character's expression and the bloodstains.  The background is entirely white.
