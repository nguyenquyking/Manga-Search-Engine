A manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A young, light-haired character, possibly Asta from Black Clover, stands with arms outstretched, a book falling from his hand.  He appears shocked or horrified, with text above him reading "...BECOME... A MURDERER!!!"  In the lower panel, a large demonic creature fires a powerful energy blast towards a distant city. The overall scene suggests a moment of intense conflict and impending destruction.
