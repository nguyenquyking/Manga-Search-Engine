A One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with a character, likely Zoro, experiencing a powerful, possibly supernatural, effect.  The first panel shows Zoro's terrified face, sweating profusely.  The second panel shows a large, dark, muscled arm appearing unexpectedly on a bed, suggesting a transformation or external force.  The third panel depicts an open ancient book with strange symbols, being flipped rapidly, and a possibly distressed Zoro in the background.  The onomatopoeia "Shup," "Hff," and "Wip" emphasize the sudden movements and exertion. The overall scene suggests a magical or cursed influence impacting Zoro.
