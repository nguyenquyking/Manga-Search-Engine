A manga panel depicting a scene in a courtroom or assembly hall.  A stern-faced man, possibly a high-ranking official, is shown centrally, contemplating a strategy.  He's discussing the disposition of a "devil user" with two royal captains and a young, seemingly clairvoyant individual. The scene suggests a political maneuver to quell a kingdom crisis by exiling the devil user and placing the brigades' responsibility on hold.  The dialogue indicates the involvement of Julius, a character whose absence is noted.  The overall atmosphere is tense and strategic.
