Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a female character (likely Noelle Silva) engaged in intense combat. Asta, using "Heavenly Prison: Faint Omen," is shown in a strained position, possibly struggling against an opponent.  Noelle, meanwhile, has used "Sealing Recovery Magic" to seal away physical damage.  A monstrous dark entity is attacking, with speech bubbles indicating attacks like "Die!" and "Perish!".  The scene is dynamic, with dark magical energy and intense facial expressions conveying the struggle.
