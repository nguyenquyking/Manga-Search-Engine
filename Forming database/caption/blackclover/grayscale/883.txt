Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A demonic-looking female character, possibly a magic user, unleashes dark, spiky energy outwards with a maniacal expression.  She is labeled as the source of powerful magic. Asta, with spiky hair, is shown in the foreground, seemingly reacting to the energy blast.  Another female character, with a crown of roses and pale skin, is also present, appearing wounded yet determined.  The scene suggests a powerful attack, with Asta and the crowned woman witnessing the unleashed magic.  The text bubbles indicate dialogue about teamwork and the strength of the female character's blood magic.
