A manga panel depicting a powerful, winged female figure, possibly an angel or goddess, protecting a book with large, outstretched wings.  The text indicates she is a mother protecting her children. This powerful being is contrasted with a smaller, darker-clothed figure, possibly a demon or antagonist, in the bottom panel, observing the scene. The overall scene suggests a conflict or a moment of intense protection.  The visual style is characteristic of a manga comic.
