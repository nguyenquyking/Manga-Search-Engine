Two figures, seemingly female, are ensnared by dark, tentacle-like appendages.  They appear distressed and are being restrained.  A third panel shows a cloaked figure, possibly a villain, with a bird-like mask, suggesting a sinister presence.  The final panel shows several dark, bloodied puddles on the ground. The overall scene depicts a dark, possibly violent confrontation.  The style is consistent with manga artwork.
