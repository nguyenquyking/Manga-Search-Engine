Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A female character, possibly Noelle Silva, is shown in multiple panels, undergoing a powerful magical transformation or attack.  She is surrounded by intense energy and dark markings appear on her body.  The panels show her in different stages of the transformation, with motion lines suggesting movement and energy release.  Text bubbles indicate the character's determination ("NOT YET!!!") and a possible opponent's question ("Not yet...?"). Another panel shows a smaller figure possibly an enemy or ally, in the background.  The overall scene is dynamic and high-energy, indicative of a crucial moment in the fight.
