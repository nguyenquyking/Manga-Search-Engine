A manga panel depicts a bald, cloaked figure, possibly a sorcerer, casting "Poison Creation Magic: Basilisk's Breath."  The magic manifests as a large, monstrous, dripping mass of poison, engulfing the surrounding area.  The sorcerer declares his spell to be "top-stage," indicating its power. Another panel shows a close-up of a giant eye, suggesting a victim succumbing to the poison, deemed "useless" and insufficient "fodder for the fortress." The overall scene is one of overwhelming magical power and impending defeat.
