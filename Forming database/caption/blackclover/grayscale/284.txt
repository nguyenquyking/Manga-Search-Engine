A Black Clover manga panel depicts Asta, exhibiting concern, interacting with a formally dressed, masked man.  The masked man, seemingly a medical expert, explains his family's history in handling curses and poisons, stating he was unable to cure Asta's ancient curse but can treat normal illnesses.  Asta's temperature is confirmed as normal. The scene shows the masked man gesturing and speaking, while Asta listens with a worried expression.  Other characters are visible in the background, but their roles are unclear.  The visual style is consistent with Black Clover's distinctive manga art.
