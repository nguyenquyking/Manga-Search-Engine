A Black Clover manga panel depicts Noelle Silva, seated regally in a dark ornate chair, observing several figures.  Two individuals in dark uniforms stand before her; one appears to be a subordinate reporting intruders.  In the lower panel, additional figures in dark attire confront another character, possibly engaging in combat.  The scene suggests an encounter between Noelle and uninvited guests, possibly antagonists, within a stone edifice.  The visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga's distinctive art.
