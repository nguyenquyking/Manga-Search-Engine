A devil-like figure, seemingly weak and magicless, walks through a village where villagers react with fear and disgust, calling for the Magic Knights.  The devil, narrating his experience, explains that he was already "torn up" and indifferent to humans' fear. He describes his body becoming immobile, prompting his escape from the pursuing villagers wielding powerful magic. The scene depicts a contrast between the devil's apathy and the villagers' terrified reactions.
