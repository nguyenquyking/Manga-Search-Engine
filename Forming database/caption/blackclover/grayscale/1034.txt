A black and white manga panel depicts a dramatic scene.  A character, possibly a demon or dark magic user with pointed ears and dark hair, is shown in the bottom panel, seemingly witnessing or reacting to an event above.  Above him, a powerful magical attack, labeled "Star Magic: Quartile," explodes outward, represented by radiating lines and starbursts.  The spell is labeled "Scutum" indicating a defensive or protective nature.  At the top of the panel, a winged figure floats serenely,  possibly a divine or angelic being, and states "He's all yours!!!"  The overall scene suggests a significant power transfer or magical attack.
