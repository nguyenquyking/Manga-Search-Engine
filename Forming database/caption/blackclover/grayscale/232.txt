Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a character uses "Scale Magic".  A man in priestly robes manipulates a large scale, shrinking a group of magical users.  One of the smaller figures exclaims about shrinking.  The scale magic user explains that his magic measures ability, shifts balance, and establishes order.  The panel shows a dramatic contrast between the powerful magic being used and the seemingly insignificant scale used to control it.  The title card reads "Scale Regulate" and "Scale Magic".
