Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where Asta, a young magic knight, is requesting help.  He is shown in the panel next to another character, who appears distressed and acknowledges Asta's request.  Asta states he needs time to unleash his full power, while the other character pleads for his help, emphasizing their inability to combat the threat depicted in the background (a large, dark mass possibly indicating an attack or monster). The background shows a large city under attack.
