Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a young man with spiky hair, surrounded by swirling energy, having survived a powerful explosion.  Asta is shown using his own powers to withstand the blast. Another character, seemingly a higher-ranking individual, observes Asta, commenting on his strength and the survival of the Heart Kingdom's citizens thanks to Asta's actions.  The scene highlights Asta's immense power and growth over the past half-year.  The panel also includes speech bubbles expressing both Asta's determination ("Not strong enough!!") and the observer's praise.
