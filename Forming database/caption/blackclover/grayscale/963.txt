Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character, possibly Asta, uses magic, creating a large, dark, glyph-covered energy blast aimed at an opponent. The opponent appears to be a powerful, armored figure.  The attack is forceful, causing significant visual effects.  Asta's determined facial expression is shown in a close-up panel below the main action.  The text "This is as far as you go" indicates the attack's decisive nature.  Other characters are visible in smaller panels, seemingly observing the confrontation.
