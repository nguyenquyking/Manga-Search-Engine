Manga panel depicting a confrontation between a Supreme Devil and several other characters.  The Devil, monstrous in appearance, is surrounded by smaller, seemingly demonic figures.  These figures express their inability to defeat the Devil, while text bubbles indicate their intention to kill an unseen "him."  A female character with long dark hair is shown in the top panel, seemingly exhausted or defeated. The final panel shows the Devil's claw-like hands approaching the female character, who is screaming, with text indicating that the Devil wants to hear her "last and finest" scream.  The overall tone suggests a climactic battle scene.
