One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle. A dark, shadowy figure with horns, possibly a devil fruit user or antagonist, is engaged in combat with a character whose face is obscured, likely the protagonist or a key ally.  The dark figure is emitting dark tendrils or energy, and the other character is shown moving rapidly, possibly attacking or evading.  Impact and motion lines show intense action and force. The scene is filled with  onomatopoeia representing impact sounds ('KRAK', 'SHHH', 'WHUD').  The antagonist is laughing maniacally ("Wah ha ha ha ha!!!").  The overall style is dynamic and violent, typical of One Piece's action sequences.
