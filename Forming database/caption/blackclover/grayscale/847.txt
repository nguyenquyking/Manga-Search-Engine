A Black Clover manga panel shows Asta, internally agonizing over his perceived weakness.  He's sweating profusely and his face is contorted in distress.  He's thinking about his Black Bulls squad, depicted in a smaller panel as a group, and resolving not to rely on his magic.  Asta is shown in a separate panel, appearing grim and resolute.  The text bubbles express his internal conflict and determination.
