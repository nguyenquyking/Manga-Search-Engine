In a separate panel, Asta and the horned opponent are shown in close-up; Asta is smirking confidently while his opponent speaks, suggesting a strategic element in the fight.  The text bubbles indicate a discussion about magical abilities and regeneration.  The overall scene suggests a fierce and strategically-driven clash between powerful opponents.
