A snow-covered town with a large castle is shown in the background.  In the foreground, three panels depict different scenes.  The first shows a man in glasses looking towards a clock tower in the snowy town. The second shows a man with sunglasses, possibly a scientist, smiling subtly, and a small figure in a furry hood beside him.  Text states "They've shown themselves." The third panel shows another man, possibly a scientist, seated at a computer console in a room filled with complex wiring and blank monitors. The word "Well, well," is written in a speech bubble.
