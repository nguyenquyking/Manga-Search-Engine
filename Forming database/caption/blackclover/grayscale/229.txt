Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple characters and interactions.  A stern-looking man with spiky hair smokes, stating they're "a big mix of weirdos."  Another character, Nero, a young person with short hair and devil horns, destroys magical rings, saying "That's...".  A third character, with short, light-colored hair and a facial injury, expresses gratitude for "five hundred years" of service.  The scene showcases magical energy and a change of era.  The overall tone is serious and slightly ominous.
