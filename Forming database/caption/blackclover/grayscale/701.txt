Black Clover manga chapter:  A confrontation unfolds during a "Gravity Magic" spell.  Two dark-cloaked figures, possibly demons, face a smaller figure, potentially Jack, who is seemingly unaffected by the gravity magic.  One demon declares "I have no use for you," while the other is shown reacting with visible strain. The text "Presence of the Demon King" is prominently displayed. A panel below depicts a character (possibly Jack) and a creature resembling a horse amidst the gravity spell's effects. The question "Will Jack even be able to attack inside a gravity spell?" is posed.
