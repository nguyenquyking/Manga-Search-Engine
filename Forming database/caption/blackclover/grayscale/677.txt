One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  A powerful spatial mage (left panel), whose abilities are described as controlling and blocking opponent's mana, is contrasted with a younger, seemingly less powerful character (right panel) who uses "Archangel's Destruction," a spatial magic technique. The younger character comments on the long time since their last encounter.  The scene features a large explosion or energy burst, characteristic of a powerful spell.
