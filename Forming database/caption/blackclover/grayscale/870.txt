A manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  One character, shirtless and bound by dark chains emanating from a circular symbol on his chest, reacts with surprise and anger ("You little punk!! What did you do this time?!").  His devil power has disappeared. The other character, partially visible, looks on in shocked disbelief ("What?!").  The scene suggests a magical or supernatural power struggle.  The visual style is characteristic of Black Clover manga.
