This One Piece manga panel shows a comparison between two locations.  The top panel depicts Diamond, a city characterized by a powerful army built through mage scholars, described as aggressive and involved in human experimentation.  The city is shown nestled in a rocky landscape. The bottom panel contrasts with a depiction of Heart, a politically neutral land with abundant natural mana, which its inhabitants have adapted to create their own unique magic.  The scene shows a lush forest overlooking a city in the distance. No specific characters are shown.
