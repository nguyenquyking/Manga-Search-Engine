Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A blond-haired character is shown being affected by a spatial magic attack, indicated by swirling lines and a splitting effect around them.  Another character, with dark hair and horns, observes, commenting "A spatial mage, hm?". A third character, partially visible, remarks "Maybe it's good that I got him early," suggesting a successful preemptive strike. The scene depicts a confrontation between the blond character and a spatial mage, with the latter having seemingly gained the upper hand.  The visual style is consistent with the dynamic action sequences typical of One Piece.
