Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A Black Clover manga panel depicts Asta, sweat-drenched and shirtless, running with a determined expression.  He's visibly strained, exclaiming "I... can't move?!"  Another panel shows a figure's legs and boots, questioning Asta's sudden movement with "Where are you going, hm?".  Prior panels show a blurry figure, possibly an opponent, moving swiftly, indicated by speed lines.  The overall scene suggests a high-stakes moment of action and struggle for Asta.
