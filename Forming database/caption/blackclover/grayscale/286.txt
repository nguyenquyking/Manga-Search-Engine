Black Clover manga scene depicting a map showing the spread of a curse across a country.  Atop the map, a tall man in a top hat and a smaller, cloaked figure are shown.  Below, Asta, Noelle Silva, and another character (possibly Mimosa Vermillion) react to the map, identifying their hideout within the affected area.  The curse is described as incredibly fierce, with flame intensity indicating its depth and viciousness.  The scene highlights "Black Oil Creation Magic" and a "Curse Candle Ritual Disk".
