A manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A large, dark, shadowy force, labeled "DEMON-SLAYER!!," attacks, causing destruction. In the lower panels, multiple characters react with fear and shock as the attack unfolds. One character, possibly a demon, is shown with a close-up of a snarling face.  The text includes onomatopoeia such as "THOCK," "00000," and "SCREE," indicating the force and sound of the attack.  One character is heard saying, "C'mon, man..." expressing desperation or encouragement.  The scene is chaotic and suggests a powerful attack in progress.
