One Piece manga panel depicting a large-scale energy explosion or attack.  The scene shows a powerful blast emanating from a central point, radiating outwards with sharp, jagged lines suggesting intense energy.  There are no identifiable characters present; the focus is solely on the destructive force of the attack.  Onomatopoeia such as "RUMMMM," "FLARE," "KRKK," and "00000" are used to illustrate the sounds and intensity of the event.  The background suggests a damaged or crumbling environment. The overall impression is one of widespread destruction caused by a powerful energy wave.
