A Black Clover manga panel depicting a determined young man, likely a member of the House of Vaude, clenching his fist. He vows to work hard to prove his worth and gain his father's acknowledgment.  Another character, seemingly a younger sibling or relative, is shown in the background looking concerned.  The scene is tense, with dialogue boxes expressing the protagonist's ambition and a contrasting character's disapproval. The visual style is characteristic of Black Clover's manga art.
