Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, exhausted, and Lolopechka, a water-type magic user, being rescued.  Asta is shown in a close-up, mouth agape, expressing exhaustion and self-deprecation ("At this point, I'm completely useless!!!") while Lolopechka, surrounded by water and roses, thanks Asta for saving her ("Thank you for saving Lolopechka!"). The scene showcases Asta's depleted state after a battle, contrasted with Lolopechka's gratitude.  The background features stylized water effects and roses.
