Black Clover manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene. Asta, with determined expression, is shown partially obscured by a series of rapid, diagonal lines suggesting intense movement and a powerful attack.  Asta appears to be fighting against a dark, demonic entity, partially visible in the lower left, with clawed hands and shadowy wings.  In the upper right, another character, potentially Licht, is visible, also seemingly engaged in combat, exhibiting a serious facial expression and possibly wielding a sword. The panel uses strong lines and motion blur effects to convey the speed and force of the fight.  The overall visual style is high-contrast black and white, typical of Black Clover's manga art.
