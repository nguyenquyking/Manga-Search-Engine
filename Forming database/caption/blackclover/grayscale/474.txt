Black Clover manga scene:  A character with dark fur-like clothing and horns is restrained by numerous thin, sharp appendages emanating from a cloaked figure above. The cloaked figure appears to be using magic.  In another panel, a shocked, sweating character, possibly Asta, looks on in disbelief, exclaiming about the identity of the character in dark clothing.  A third panel shows a powerful, muscular figure struggling, apparently paralyzed. The text indicates this is the captain of the Golden Dawn and that the dark magic being used involves the Tree of Qliphoth.
