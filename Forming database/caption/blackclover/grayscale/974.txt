A third panel features a close-up of a female character, possibly Noelle, questioning her actions. The fourth panel shows Rill interacting with another character, and acknowledging their gratitude. The final panel shows a character shouting "GAJA!" while walking away from a tunnel where two other characters are walking towards them.  The overall theme suggests a climactic battle conclusion with emotional consequences and possibly a shared victory.
