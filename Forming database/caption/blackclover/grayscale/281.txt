A panel from a One Piece manga chapter depicts a gruesome scene inside a "curse research workshop."  A man in a top hat and dark clothing, with exaggerated makeup featuring black eyes and lips, stands amidst a chaotic collection of jars, skulls, hanging body parts, and other macabre objects on a cluttered table. He comments on the scene's beauty.  A younger, shocked character with wide eyes and an open mouth is shown reacting to the workshop's contents.  Another character, wearing a military-style cap, expresses knowledge of the man's "wicked research." The overall scene is dark and unsettling.
