A demonic entity, characterized by sharp teeth and a grotesque, skeletal visage, is depicted consuming a human.  The entity reacts with phrases like "Good, good..." and "Very, very good," expressing satisfaction.  The human's screams and agony are depicted via sound effects and text ("Screams of agony and despair," "...wrung from the straining throat of a human..."). The scene showcases a power imbalance, with the entity's overwhelming power draining the life from its victim until they are "empty".
