Black Clover manga panel depicting a romantic/intense scene.  Asta, looking stern, declares his feelings for a woman, not as his queen, but as a woman.  Another character, possibly Noelle, reacts with shock and excitement, while others in the background show surprised expressions.  There is dialogue indicating Asta's feelings and the other characters' reactions; it also hints at a prior interaction with Gaja.  The overall mood is a blend of romantic tension and surprise.
