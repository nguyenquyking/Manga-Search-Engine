Black Clover manga panel depicting a character, likely Asta, lying dazed in a circular, stone arena after a battle. He is disoriented, questioning how long he was unconscious. Another panel shows a close-up of Asta's wide, shocked eye. A subsequent panel shows a character, possibly Langris, looking into a dark, destroyed area, searching for Zenon.  The overall scene suggests the aftermath of a fierce fight, with damage visible in the arena.
