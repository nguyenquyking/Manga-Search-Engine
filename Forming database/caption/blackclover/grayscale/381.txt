Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta wielding his anti-magic sword, battling a demonic entity.  Asta is shown mid-action, his expression strained.  The demon is large and dark, emanating dark energy.  Another character, a bald man, is shown in a separate panel with a shocked expression, asking "What... did you...?".  The top panel shows a close-up of Asta's face with the text "DEMON-DESTROYER!" above him. The scene is intense and action-packed.
