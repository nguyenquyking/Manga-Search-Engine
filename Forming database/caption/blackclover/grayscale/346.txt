Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple characters in various expressions and settings.  A woman with braided hair looks pensively at roses.  A spiky-haired man with intense eyes is shown in a separate panel. Another panel shows a young child with wide eyes looking up. A masked man with sharp features is seen in profile, seemingly thoughtful.  Finally, a close-up shows another spiky-haired character with a serious expression, possibly Asta. The panels suggest a range of emotions and possibly different scenes within a larger narrative.  Nostra (the woman) and Asta are depicted, along with other, currently unnamed characters.
