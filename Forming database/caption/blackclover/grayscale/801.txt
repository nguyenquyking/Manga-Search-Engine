One Piece manga panel depicting a shadowy, hellish scene.  A character, seemingly the antagonist, invites another to a "hellish game of tag" within a "Shadow Magic: Monument of Atonement." This monument is a dark, cube-shaped structure filled with numerous shadowy tendrils and what appears to be skulls. The antagonist, partially obscured, plans to trap the other character inside a "world of shadows" by sacrificing themself. The setting is described as a place "with no light, life or death."  The visual style is dark and ominous, emphasizing the supernatural nature of the scene.
