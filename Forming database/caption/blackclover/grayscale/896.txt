Black Clover manga panel depicting Noelle Silva and an unseen character, possibly a flashback of her mother. Noelle is shown in two panels: one expressing disbelief and questioning the nature of kindness and affection, and the other showing her emotional reaction.  Another panel shows a sorrowful Noelle's mother or a similar figure. The narrative focuses on Noelle's internal conflict regarding her actions, specifically her decision not to reveal the "Saint Stage" to someone, questioning if her kindness and affection were mistakes.  The visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga.
