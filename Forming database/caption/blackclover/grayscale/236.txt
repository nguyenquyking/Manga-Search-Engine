Black Clover manga panel description:  A high-ranking official, possibly the Wizard King's representative, announces a mission from the Wizard King.  The mission involves those suspected of having ties to devils, who are to be exiled and kept under observation.  The Black Bulls Magic Knight Brigade is shown, with some members reacting with surprise ("Wha...?!!") to the announcement. The scene takes place in a large hall or courtroom.  The official is shown holding a document, and the Black Bulls are depicted in a separate panel, seemingly abroad and assigned the mission of investigating devils.
