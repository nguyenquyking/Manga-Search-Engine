Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between a past and present generation of characters.  A scarred, crowned male figure (likely a First Wizard King) speaks to a young female Magic Knight, expressing satisfaction in protecting the future.  The scene shows the Magic Knights, including Asta and other Clover Kingdom members, standing on a high point, overlooking a landscape.  The female Magic Knight expresses her satisfaction with the outcome, and the panel also shows younger versions of the female Magic Knight.  The overall tone is one of reflection and accomplishment.
