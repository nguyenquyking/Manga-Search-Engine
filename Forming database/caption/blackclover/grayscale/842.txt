Black Clover manga panel depicting three members of the Black Bulls squad —  a masked individual addressed as "Chief," another with spiky hair and sunglasses, and a third with shorter hair — emerging from a sandy, rubble-strewn area. The spiky-haired member says "Yo...".  A fourth, horned individual, possibly a devil or demon, looks up in surprise, saying "Huh?". The scene suggests a post-battle or chaotic situation.  The overall tone is intense and action-oriented.
