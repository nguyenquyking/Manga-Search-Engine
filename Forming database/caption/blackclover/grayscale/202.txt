Here's a caption describing the One Piece manga panel:  A powerful vortex of dark energy erupts in a circular arena, likely caused by a Devil Fruit ability.  Observers, including three men in formal attire (one with long hair, another with a beard, and a third with a hat), react with shock and fear.  One man exclaims, "Look at him!", while another remarks, "You've made it real clear..."  The panel showcases the intense power and the observers' awe and fear. The text "How you operate!!" suggests a questioning of the source of the power.
