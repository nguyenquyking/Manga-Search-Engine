A manga panel depicting a scene where a powerful, dark, winged entity, seemingly emanating from a cracked wall, is observed by a man with spiky hair and stubble, smoking a cigarette.  The entity's magic is labeled "Word Soul Magic," and the man comments on its "nasty" nature and the entity's remaining power. The man's dialogue emphasizes the difference between himself and the creature.  The scene is dark and ominous, with the entity's presence dominating the upper panel.
