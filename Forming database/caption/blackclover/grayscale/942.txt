A manga panel depicting a dark scene.  A monstrous figure, possibly Lolopechka, threatens to detonate, killing all humans in the castle.  The figure is partially manifested, with its face and upper body visible, showing dark features and a third eye.  Another smaller, similarly monstrous figure is partially visible in the lower right.  A smaller, seemingly human or humanoid figure is shown being consumed or overtaken by dark tendrils in the background.  The overall tone suggests impending destruction and a dark magical power at play.
