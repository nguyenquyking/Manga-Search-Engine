Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, sweating profusely and displaying his anti-magic Ki, facing a shadowy devil-like figure.  Asta states he can tell the opponent isn't trying to kill him, while another character, possibly a dark-clothed observer, questions Asta's assertion, stating that his opponent *is* a devil and that devils don't have principles.  The scene highlights a tense confrontation with differing perspectives on the opponent's intentions.
