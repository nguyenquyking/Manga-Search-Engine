A demonic figure, seemingly bisected, is depicted in a manga-style panel.  The creature has horns, sharp teeth, and a stitched or scarred appearance.  It is surrounded by jagged, dark shapes suggestive of claws or teeth, and ink splatter effects enhance the chaotic and violent nature of the scene.  No other characters are visible. The image strongly conveys a sense of darkness and power.
