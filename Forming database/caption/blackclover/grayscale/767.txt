One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, reptilian creature attacks a smaller, humanoid figure, causing a large explosion.  Another panel shows a group of monstrous figures observing the fight, with dialogue suggesting they intend to continue the conflict.  The smaller humanoid figure appears to be significantly weaker than the reptilian creature and the observing monsters.  The scene is characterized by intense action and dark, dramatic visuals.
