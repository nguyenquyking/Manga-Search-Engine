A powerful dark magic attack, possibly from a high-level character, sweeps across a battlefield.  Multiple figures are shown fleeing the blast.  In the foreground, Asta and a smaller, possibly younger character, react in shock to the destruction.  The scene features dramatic action lines and onomatopoeia ("FWASH," "KRAKKADOOM") indicating the scale and force of the attack.  The main focus is on the devastating impact of the magic, and the characters' horrified response.
