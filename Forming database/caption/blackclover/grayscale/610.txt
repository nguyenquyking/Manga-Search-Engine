Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A close-up panel shows a smiling, dark-haired character, possibly a devil or demon, surrounded by smaller shadowy figures.  A speech bubble above him reads "YOU CHOSE RIGHT." The character's expression is one of smug satisfaction.  A subsequent panel shows a smaller, lighter-haired character, Asta, with wide, surprised eyes, next to a smaller demonic figure labeled "BOING". Asta's expression suggests shock or alarm. The scene implies a choice has been made, resulting in a confrontation or interaction between the two main characters. The overall tone is suspenseful.
