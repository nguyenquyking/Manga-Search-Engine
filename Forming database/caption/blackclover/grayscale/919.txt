Black Clover manga scene depicting a hidden attack.  A character (unidentified) is dissolving, surrounded by dark energy and sound effects indicating pain and disintegration.  Text reveals this is part of a larger plan ("preparations for my descent are all in place").  Simultaneously, another panel shows a powerful mage, possibly a woman judging by the hair and clothing, reacting with shock ("It's impossible!!") to the unfolding events, linked to a curse ("The power of this curse").  The presence of three powerful mages' souls is noted, unseen by Lucifero and others.  The visual style is characteristic of Black Clover's action sequences, utilizing dynamic lines and expressive character faces.
