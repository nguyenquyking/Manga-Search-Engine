A Black Clover manga color spread depicting a stern-faced character, possibly Asta's enemy, declaring, "I never will," even if God and devils forgive them.  The following panels show a group in a meeting, with one character admitting limitations, stating "I know my own limits. I can do my best, but no more," while another character, possibly Asta, grimly acknowledges the inability to defeat the Dark Triad.  The overall mood is serious and foreboding.
