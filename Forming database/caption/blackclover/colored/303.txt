A colored manga panel depicting a sprawling, idyllic island nation viewed from above.  A woman with silver hair expresses amazement at the scene.  Below, Asta (with surprised expression), another character (possibly a king or high-ranking individual with golden jewelry), and a woman with brown hair are shown reacting to the scene.  Astaâ€™s thought bubble shows a question mark. Dialogue boxes express wonder at the peace brought to the nation and uncertainty about the future.  The overall scene suggests a moment of reflection and anticipation following a significant event.
