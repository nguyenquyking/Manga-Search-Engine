A manga panel depicting a fierce battle. A powerful, horned figure with pale skin and long white hair (likely an antagonist) unleashes an overwhelming attack, labeled "Overwhelming Power," causing a large explosion.  Another character, seemingly an opponent, is shown being struck and defeated, their attack deemed "Pointless" by the dominant figure. The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia ("THWAP," "BOOM," "GRUNCH," "WHUD") emphasizing the impact of the attack. The color palette is intense, with fiery oranges and reds contrasting against cool blues and greens.  The style is characteristic of action-oriented manga.
