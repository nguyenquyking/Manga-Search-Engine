A Black Clover manga panel depicts a massive, dark purple, tentacled entity emanating from another dimension.  A demonic-looking figure with red eyes and sharp teeth is partially visible within the entity.  Two characters, Asta and a blonde woman (likely Noelle Silva), react with expressions of shock and disbelief. Asta is positioned to the right of the central entity.  Another character, with dark hair, observes the scene with a look of intense concentration and concern.  Thorny, dark green vines with red roses sprout around the edges.  Speech bubbles reveal the entity's declaration of being from another dimension and the other characters' reactions of awe and confusion.  The overall scene is dark and ominous.
