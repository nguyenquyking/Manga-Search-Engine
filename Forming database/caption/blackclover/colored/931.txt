Close-up of a determined female character, possibly Noelle Silva from Black Clover, with sweat and blood on her face, shouting.  Her expression is fierce, eyes wide and pink.  Speech bubbles indicate her declaration: "...lies in not giving up!!!" and another shows "...our strength...". The lower portion shows a partially visible, pale-skinned antagonist with glowing purple eyes. The scene is intense, focusing on the female character's resolve in the face of adversity.
