A dark-cloaked figure, possibly a demon or villain, with horns and a shadowy appearance, unleashes a large, exploding fireball.  The panels depict the character's action, the fireball's creation and explosion, and the character's subsequent reaction, seemingly surprised by the result. The text "EXPLODING FIREBALL!!!" indicates the nature of the attack.  No other characters are clearly visible.
