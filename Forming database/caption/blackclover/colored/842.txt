Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A manga panel depicts a scene where two characters are performing a magic ritual.  One character, seemingly the more powerful one, explains that he's created a one-time-only spell, splitting his considerable magical power (1000) with the other character (resulting in 1000 and 2).  The powerful character boasts about the complexity and time investment (half a year) in creating this spell.  The visual elements include a large glowing chain, representing magical energy, and a diagram illustrating the magical power distribution. The smaller character's reaction is implied by the final speech bubble.
