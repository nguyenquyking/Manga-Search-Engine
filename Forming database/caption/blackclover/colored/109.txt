Black Clover manga color spread depicting a fierce battle.  A character with dark hair and a sinister grin, wielding a powerful slashing magic ("Death Scythe"), dominates the left panel.  He's actively attacking another character, shown mid-air in a green outfit, falling towards a large pool of crimson magic.  Text indicates the attacker's ability to continuously attack as long as their opponent uses recovery magic.  In a smaller panel, a shocked, light-haired female character pleads for the fight to stop.  The scene showcases intense action and contrasting magical abilities.
