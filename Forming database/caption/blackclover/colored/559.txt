This Black Clover fan art depicts Asta and a young woman, likely a human, throughout the changing seasons.  The panels show their evolving relationship.  Initially, they are depicted fishing, playing, and sharing meals. As the seasons change, they become closer, culminating in a scene where the woman comforts Asta in bed and builds a snowman with him in the winter. The final panel shows the woman affirming that Asta, despite being a devil, is not a bad person.  The art style is reminiscent of the manga.
