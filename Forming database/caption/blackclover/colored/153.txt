Black Clover manga page depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows an angry character with red markings on their face (likely a magical effect) yelling at a masked individual, identified as the former captain of the Purple Orcas. The second shows two characters, possibly Asta and a blonde-haired individual, discussing the peaceful nature of the Clover Kingdom. The final scene shows the characters escaping a stone structure with a circular symbol, indicating a magical barrier or seal.  The overall theme suggests a successful escape from a dangerous situation.
