Black Clover manga panel depicting a nighttime scene.  The top panels show a large, hilltop town at night, dominated by a tall, round building with a cross on top, possibly a church or monastery. The bottom panel shows several characters seated before a large, swirling, light-blue magical entity.  A man in a light-colored uniform sits within this entity.  Text indicates this is Asta, and his life is not in danger.  The seated characters appear to be members of the Black Bulls.  The scene suggests a magical ritual or observation.
