Asta, from Black Clover, is shown experiencing a powerful transformation.  The image depicts him in several panels: initially, he's sweating profusely, looking fearful and distressed; then, he's in bed, his arm displaying a dark red, vein-like pattern that seems to be spreading across his body; finally, he's shown again, struggling with the transformation while an ancient, glowing book is visible nearby, seemingly the source of the transformation. The book contains unfamiliar glyphs. The panels emphasize Asta's struggle and the intensity of the magical power he is undergoing.
