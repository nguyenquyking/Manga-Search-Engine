Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple characters in flight, propelled by a green energy current.  The central figure, seemingly the source of the energy, is unseen except for a glimpse of green hair and clothing. Several other characters, possibly members of a squad, are shown flying behind, wearing similar blue cloaks and white uniforms.  The scene is punctuated by text expressing admiration for the unseen character's strength and leadership, contrasting with a final panel showing a close-up of a wounded character's face expressing frustration ("It's galling...").  The overall tone suggests a powerful display of teamwork and a hint of rivalry or complex emotions.
