Close-up of Asta and Nacht Faust from Black Clover.  Asta, with blood on his face, looks up at Nacht, who has a dark, serious expression. Nacht has a devil-like horn and a dark mark across his face.  A purple energy effect is between them. The lower panel shows a close-up of a character's wide, fearful eyes.
