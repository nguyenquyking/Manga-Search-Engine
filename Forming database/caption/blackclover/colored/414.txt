A Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta's enraged reaction,  Noelle's apparent defeat, and Vanica's triumphant declaration.  Asta's face is shown in extreme close-up, screaming "VAN/CAAA!!" with blood on his mouth.  In another panel,  Vanica, the queen of the Spade Kingdom, stands over a defeated Noelle, who lies on the ground in a white dress. Vanica speaks,  "Okay, I'll be waiting for you in the Spade Kingdom!" A final panel shows Noelle seemingly incapacitated, surrounded by blue energy, with Vanica's eye visible in the corner.  A speech bubble over Noelle encourages her to "GET STRONGER, N-O-E-L-L-E."  The overall scene conveys intense conflict and determination.
