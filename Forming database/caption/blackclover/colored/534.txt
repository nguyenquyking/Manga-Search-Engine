Two figures, seemingly male, stand before a dilapidated mansion.  One wears a dark cloak, the other a lighter-colored sleeveless tunic and trousers.  The mansion is heavily overgrown with vines, windows are broken, and the overall structure appears ruined.  Inside the mansion, a further panel reveals a destroyed interior with broken furniture and a damaged staircase. A framed family portrait lies on the floor.  The text indicates the house belonged to a former noble.
