A colored manga panel depicts a scene where a gate to the underworld is opening.  Morris, a light-skinned man in a white robe, stands within a glowing blue circle at the center of a complex ritual.  A dark-haired character with red eyes, partially obscured by a dark mask, observes, expressing uncertainty about the process.  The masked character is then shown from a different angle, rejecting a suggestion to eliminate Morris, with a speech bubble reading "NO!!!".  The scene is highlighted by a bright blue beam representing the opening gate and purple symbols on the ground.
