One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character, possibly Luffy, uses a powerful red attack, "Red Beast," against a massive blue wave attack, "Point-Blank Sea Dragon's Roar," launched by an unseen opponent.  The impact creates a violent explosion of water and energy. Another character is shown being thrown back by the force.  The text "LOLOPECHKA!" suggests either a battle cry or name of a technique. The overall scene is highly dynamic and action-packed, showing a clash of powerful abilities.
