Close-up of a character's crimson eye with radiating veins, labeled "Shadow Magic".  A second panel shows a swirling, ethereal pattern emanating from the ground, labeled "Heaven's Shadow Second Sight". The third panel depicts a magical symbol, possibly Qliphoth, with text indicating the sensing of magic near Yami and Vangeance, at the site of the Qliphoth's advent underground.  The overall scene suggests a magical confrontation or ritual involving powerful forces.  No specific character names beyond Yami and Vangeance are explicitly shown, though the eye in the first panel may belong to one of the antagonists.
