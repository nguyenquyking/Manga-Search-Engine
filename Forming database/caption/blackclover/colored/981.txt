Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Yami Sukehiro, seemingly fatigued, is shown conversing with a character who is implied to be Noelle Silva, the Clover Kingdom's strongest spatial mage.  They are observing a powerful, skeletal, dark-winged figure (likely a demon) unleashing a wide-ranging attack. The text bubbles indicate concern from Yami regarding Noelle's strategy, and Noelle's confidence in her plan to counter the attack. The visual focus is on the powerful attack, the characters' expressions, and the dialogue implying a strategic shift in the battle.
