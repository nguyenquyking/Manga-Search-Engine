A manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A shirtless man with dark hair and a burning, intricate symbol on his chest, seemingly in pain, is surrounded by fiery chains.  He exclaims, "You little punk!! What did you do this time?!"  Another man, partially obscured, in the background appears shocked, saying "What?!"  The main character's devil power appears to have disappeared, as text indicates "The Devil's Power Disappeared Entirely..."  The scene is filled with dramatic energy and dark, fiery hues.
