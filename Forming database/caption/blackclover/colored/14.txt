Black Clover manga page 203 depicts a powerful magical attack.  A large, purple, vine-like magical entity dominates the scene.  A blonde female character, possibly Noelle Silva, is shown reacting with shock and tears, seemingly witnessing or affected by the magic.  The text indicates an attack from "the next world" and the attempt to "undo the magic."  Another character is visible, smaller and farther away, possibly observing the event. The overall tone suggests a climactic and intense battle scene.
