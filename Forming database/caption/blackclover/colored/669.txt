A female character with dark hair, a crown, and a red, cyclopean eye modified a curse into a special anti-curse spell.  The scene shows her face and eye close-up, with text bubbles detailing her actions and another character's reaction ("Fascinating!!").  Smaller panels showcase related story elements: "The Rune Arrays of the Heart Kingdom," "The Elves' Reincarnation," and "Missions and Friendly Rivalries with the Magic Knights."  A final panel shows a close-up of another character's mouth and the statement, "This is my current Blue Rose...Everything up till now has nourished my magic." No character names are explicitly given.
