A manga panel depicting a confrontation. A large, menacing brown bear with glowing teal energy emanating from its chest dominates the central panel. A shorter, dark-haired character, possibly male, wielding teal energy blades, faces the bear, seemingly prepared to attack.  The character's expression is determined.  In the adjacent panels, a taller, dark-haired character, possibly male, observes the scene with a confident expression. This character states, "IT'S FINE. I CAN SLASH THROUGH THAT."  Autumn leaves fall around the characters and bear, enhancing the scene's setting.  The art style is reminiscent of One Piece, with emphasis on dynamic poses and energy effects.
