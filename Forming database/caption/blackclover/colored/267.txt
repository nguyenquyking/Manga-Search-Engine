Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and Noelle Silva. Asta, in his Black Bulls uniform, greets Noelle enthusiastically, commenting on her appearance. Noelle is visibly flustered by Asta's declaration of wanting to look at her forever.  A previous panel shows Asta seemingly out of place, away from Captain Yami. The scene is lighthearted and romantic, with visual cues emphasizing Noelle's blushing and Asta's playful expression.  Halloween-themed decorations are in the background.
