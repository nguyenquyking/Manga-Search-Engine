Black Clover manga scene depicting a powerful antagonist, possibly a demon, declaring the end of humanity.  The antagonist is large, dark, and menacing, surrounded by dark red energy.  The text bubbles convey its arrogant and cruel pronouncements.  In contrast, Asta and Yuno are shown in the lower panels, reacting to the threat.  Asta expresses determination ("That's my line, Asta...!"), while Yuno questions the antagonist's continued existence ("You still alive, Yuno?").  The final panel shows Asta and Yuno preparing to attack, with green energy surrounding their weapons.  The scene is characterized by dramatic tension and a clash of powers.
