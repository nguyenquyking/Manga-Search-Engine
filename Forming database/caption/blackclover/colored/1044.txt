A Black Clover manga panel depicts a demonic figure, possibly Lucifero, unleashing a powerful purple energy attack.  The attack consists of multiple energy blasts that are causing damage and destruction in the background. The demon's expression suggests victory, with the word "win" appearing in a speech bubble. A close-up in the lower panel shows a character's intense, dark eyes, possibly the opponent reacting to the attack.  Text below the main action states, "The stronger... the mage... the more..." hinting at a power scaling mechanic.
