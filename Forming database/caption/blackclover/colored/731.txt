A colored manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character with white hair and sharp teeth is screaming, seemingly struck by teal, energy-like projectiles.  These projectiles are launched by a larger, pale-skinned antagonist with horns and glowing orange eyes.  The antagonist is shown  blocking or deflecting the attacks, text stating,  "...for that very reason, it has no way to block...".  Another panel shows the antagonist's attack labeled "Anti-Magic Attacks!!". The overall scene is dynamic and action-packed, with a color scheme dominated by purples, reds, and teals.
