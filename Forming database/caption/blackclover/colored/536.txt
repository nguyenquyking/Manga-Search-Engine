Black Clover manga scene: Asta, a surprised and slightly fearful expression on his face, is being led into a large, dark chamber by a cloaked figure.  The chamber is illuminated by bright blue magical energy emanating from structures adorned with skulls.  Another figure, possibly a teacher or mentor, stands in the background, observing. Astaâ€™s rapid descent into the chamber is shown in a separate panel, indicating a sudden transportation.  The overall mood is ominous and suggests the start of intense magical training.
