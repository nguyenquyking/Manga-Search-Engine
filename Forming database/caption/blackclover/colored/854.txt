One Piece manga panel depicting a intense battle scene.  A horned character (likely a devil fruit user) is attacked by a character with grey hair and an orange mask. The masked character uses a magic-based chain attack, yelling "I busted my brain to come up with this magic strategy... and I trained for it like crazy."  The horned character is telling the masked character to "Stay Down!!" while seemingly restrained by the chains. The masked character counters with "You've got no right..."  The overall scene is dynamic, showcasing powerful magic abilities and a fierce confrontation.
