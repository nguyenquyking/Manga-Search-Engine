A manga panel depicting two characters, one with silver hair and dark clothing (left), and another with dark hair and a sleeveless shirt (right).  The silver-haired character recounts hearing rumors of a foreigner using eerie magic, leading them to seek him out.  The dark-haired character responds aggressively ("What's with you, punk?") but acknowledges their past interactions, noting their similar magic attributes led to an unlikely friendship. The scene concludes with both characters running, implying they frequently got into trouble together.  A grimoire is prominently featured, suggesting magic is central to the narrative.
