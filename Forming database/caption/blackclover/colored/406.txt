Black Clover manga scene depicting a battle between two characters.  A character with dark, demonic features and white hair (likely a transformed character, possibly Lucifero) is shown with blood dripping from their mouth, stating that their opponent's attacks are ineffective.  Their opponent, partially visible, is being attacked with blue, water-like energy and shows signs of injury. The dialogue indicates the attacker's powerlessness against the dark-haired character's defenses. The overall scene is dark and intense, filled with energetic splashes of blue energy.
