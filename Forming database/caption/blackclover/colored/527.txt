One Piece manga panel depicting a conversation between several characters.  Gaja, a dark-haired man with purple eyes and a scar, is shown prominently in the first panel.  A blond-haired character, possibly a prince or noble, is seen in a subsequent panel announcing an impending invasion of the Spade Kingdom in three days. Other characters are present, indicating a council or meeting.  A later panel shows Gaja, now seemingly with others, pledging support and alliance in the upcoming battle to reclaim their queen. The overall scene suggests strategic planning and alliance-building before a significant conflict.
