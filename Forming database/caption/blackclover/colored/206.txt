Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a young man with spiky black hair and a black-and-gold outfit, standing in handcuffs before a group of nobles.  Asta is identified as an orphan from the Hage Village Church of the Forsaken Region, lacking magical power.  A man in a red robe holds a scale and a glowing green box, seemingly examining Asta's status.  Another panel shows a young woman with black horns and a black dress, also in handcuffs, described as having no birth record in the kingdom; her horns are noted as proof of forbidden magic.  The scene suggests a trial or interrogation of Asta and the horned woman.
