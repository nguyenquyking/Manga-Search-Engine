A Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Top panel shows Asta, his face partially obscured by a green, spiky helmet-like formation, seemingly unleashing a powerful attack, indicated by bright yellow energy bursts and motion lines.  He appears strained, with a visible wound. Text indicates a surprised exclamation ("RGH...!!!") and a question ("ALREADY A DEVIL?"). The middle panel shows a dark-haired character with pale skin and a unique facial scar, looking down with a serious expression.  The bottom panel shows a glowing blue cube containing a faint image of a winged figure wielding a staff, seemingly trapped within. Purple energy lines converge around the cube.
