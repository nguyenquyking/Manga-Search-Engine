Manga panel depicting multiple characters engaged in intense dialogue.  Two female characters, one with long white hair and the other with short, dark hair, are shown in separate panels discussing their failure to protect someone named Lolopechka.  A third character, a male with dark hair, is shown expressing doubt about their ability to become strong quickly.  A fourth character, possibly a leader figure, questions their approach and expresses skepticism about their rapid growth. The overall mood is one of urgency and determination, with the characters resolving to become significantly stronger.  The visual style is consistent with a manga/anime aesthetic.
