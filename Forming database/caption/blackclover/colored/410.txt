Black Clover manga color spread depicting a large-scale destruction scene in the Heart Kingdom.  A massive, dark blue wave-like force engulfs the kingdom's architecture, with red, vine-like structures emerging from the ground.  In a separate panel, a character resembling Vanica is ensnared by glowing green vines while another character, possibly Noelle, looks on in distress.  A third panel shows a close-up of a man, seemingly trying to subdue Vanica, while expressing annoyance. Text bubbles reveal dialogue between the characters, indicating urgency and surprise at Vanica's return.  The overall scene suggests a powerful magical attack and a significant development in the plot.
