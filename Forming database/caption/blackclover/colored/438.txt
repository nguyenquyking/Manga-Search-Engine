Two Black Bulls members,  attacking a powerful, horned, crowned figure amidst a massive rock explosion.  The upper panel shows two figures, possibly Asta and another member, fleeing from the central explosion and a shadowy, horned figure. The lower panel depicts a closer view of the battle, with one member (potentially Asta) engaging the horned figure directly, surrounded by falling rocks and magical energy.  Purple energy bursts are visible throughout both panels.  The scene is dynamic and depicts a powerful clash.
