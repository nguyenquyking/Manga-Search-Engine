A snow-covered town is under attack by massive, dark red, tree-like roots emerging from the ground, engulfing buildings.  Characters react in horror.  Plumede, a dark-haired character in black clothing, and a small, dark creature are shown in the lower left.  In the lower right, two individuals, a girl with glasses and red-haired man, stare in shock at the encroaching roots. Other townspeople express alarm at the scene. The roots are identified as Qliphoth.
