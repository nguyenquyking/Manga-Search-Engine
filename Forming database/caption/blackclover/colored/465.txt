A colorized manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A horned, dark-cloaked figure with devilish wings, possibly a demon or powerful antagonist, dominates the upper panel, stating, "I'd rather take that one out as well..."  The lower panel shows a dynamic action scene where Asta, with a determined expression and wide eyes, shouts,  "You're not going anywhere!!!" while surrounded by purple energy blasts. Other characters are present, seemingly allies of Asta, caught in the energy's effects. The overall scene suggests an intense battle, with the dark figure about to unleash a powerful attack.
