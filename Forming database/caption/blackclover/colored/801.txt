Asta, in his devil-union form, confronts two powerful opponents amidst fiery and icy attacks.  One opponent is a light-elemental being with white hair and wings, wielding what looks like a glowing blue energy. The other opponent appears to be a dark, shadowy figure with horns and possibly dark elemental powers. Asta's devil form is prominently showcased, labeled "Demon-Destroyer," and he appears to be launching a red energy beam.  Another panel shows a monstrous, possibly demonic, face reacting in surprise ("What?").  The scene is dynamic and chaotic, suggesting a high-stakes battle.
