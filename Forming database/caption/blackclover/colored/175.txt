Black Clover manga scene depicting multiple characters in emotional moments.  Prince Lumiere, severely injured and with depleted magic reserves, is shown centrally.  A woman with orange hair expresses her inability to heal him.  Another woman with dark hair, seemingly distraught, pledges to continue his mission.  A young girl in a black dress is also present, possibly representing the "children" Lumiere wishes to protect.  Nero (formerly Secre) is shown in the background, acknowledging the situation. The overall tone is serious and melancholic, focusing on sacrifice and the weight of responsibility.
