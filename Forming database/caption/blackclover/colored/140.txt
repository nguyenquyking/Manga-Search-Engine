Two shadowy, demonic figures confront each other.  One figure, seemingly surprised or agitated, exclaims "Geh Geh Geh." The other figure, in a close-up panel, greets the first with "Nice to meet you..." and addresses the other as "My Senior." The scene is dark, red, and ominous, featuring flames and a generally menacing atmosphere.  The figures are largely silhouetted, with only glowing red eyes and sharp teeth visible.
