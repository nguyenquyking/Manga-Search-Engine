Two dark-skinned Shining Generals, wielding flames, stand defiantly.  A speech bubble above them declares that those unable to defeat them are unworthy.  The General on the left is more muscular, while the one on the right is stout.  Both have dark clothing, and intricate markings on their bodies.  Below, the scene shifts to show "Corpse Hunting Briar Trees" and "Briar Creation Magic" along with thorny vines and blue roses.  The overall scene depicts a tense confrontation before a magical attack.
