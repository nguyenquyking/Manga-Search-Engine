A colorized manga panel depicts a smiling, dark-haired character, possibly female, with red-eyed demonic creatures flanking them.  The speech bubble says "YOU CHOSE RIGHT."  Below, smaller panels show a demonic creature labeled "boring" interacting with another character, possibly Asta from Black Clover, who has bright green eyes and a surprised expression. The text includes "We're up!" and "HOWEVER...". The overall scene suggests a moment of triumph or revelation, possibly involving a pact or agreement with demonic entities.  The art style is reminiscent of *Black Clover*.
