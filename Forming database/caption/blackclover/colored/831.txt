A manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  A powerful, dark, winged figure with a central target-like marking on its chest is prominently featured.  A character with grey hair and dark clothing is shown from behind, seemingly facing the winged figure.  Text bubbles indicate dialogue expressing disbelief and a challenge.  A second panel shows a close-up of the same grey-haired character's face, seemingly exasperated, along with additional dialogue suggesting the upcoming battle will be one-sided.  The overall tone is tense and dramatic.  No specific character names are visible in the image.
