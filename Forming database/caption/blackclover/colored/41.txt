One Piece fan art depicting a scene of intense emotional distress.  A large, red, amorphous figure, possibly Lumiere, dominates the image.  The figure's pose suggests suffering or despair. Text overlay reads "PLEASE, KILL ME !!!" indicating a plea for death.  In the background, a smaller figure is visible amidst flames, suggesting a catastrophic event. The overall color palette is dominated by fiery reds and oranges, emphasizing the dramatic and possibly violent nature of the scene.  The style is reminiscent of One Piece, but this is explicitly fan art by OneHoox (Twitter:BalckCloverTeam).
