One Piece manga panel depicting a high-speed aerial battle.  A dark-haired character, evading a purple, energy-based attack labeled "Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash,"  performs a maneuver described as "keeping his mana zone condensed and senses razor-sharp" to get close to his opponent.  The opponent's attack is shown warping space.  The scene takes place in a barren, desert-like landscape with craters.  Strategic considerations are voiced in thought bubbles concerning the opponent's gravity-based powers and the potential for counter-attack.
