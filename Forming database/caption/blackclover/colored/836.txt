A Black Clover manga panel depicting a powerful magic spell.  A horned, dark-clothed figure, possibly a demon,  holds glowing golden chains, radiating dark energy.  He's  casting a spell,  impressing another character who's visibly shocked and comments on the spell's power and unexpected nature. The second character is amazed,  stating he's no longer at 100%. The scene is dark and intense, with a background suggesting destruction.
