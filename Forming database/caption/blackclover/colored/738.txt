One Piece manga panel depicting a two-scene sequence.  The first scene shows a horde of grotesque, monstrous creatures with red eyes, rapidly multiplying.  A man, possibly a Color Clover member, reacts with fear, exclaiming "Curse yooooou!!!"  The text "Their numbers just keep growing!!!" is present.  The second scene shows two blonde-haired characters, possibly Shiuny, reacting with alarm ("No!!! They found us!!!" and "Har!!!"), as a powerful fiery explosion erupts in the background, seemingly created by a Color Clover member in a red coat.  Other Color Clover members are fleeing the blast. The overall scene depicts a perilous situation where monstrous creatures have overwhelmed the Color Clovers.
