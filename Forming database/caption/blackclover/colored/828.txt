Black Bulls members,  including a red-haired member with a mask and a purple-haired member, emerge from dark, murky water.  A third, darker-haired member is partially visible behind them. They are in a destroyed environment, possibly after a battle.  The purple-haired member says "Yo...". The red-haired member is addressed as "Chief!!".  In the lower panel, a horned, dark-cloaked figure observes them with a surprised expression, questioning, "What... are these people?".  The overall scene suggests a post-battle confrontation or discovery.
