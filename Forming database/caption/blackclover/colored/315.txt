Black Clover manga panel depicting a massive surge of mana in the sky.  A male character, possibly a mage, with dark hair and light clothing, stands below, seemingly controlling the mana. Two female characters react with expressions of shock and awe. One has light blonde hair, and the other has light grey/silver hair and a crown. The scene showcases the vast power of the mana, dwarfing the characters. Text bubbles emphasize the scale and power of the magic, highlighting that it's beyond human capabilities.
