A manga comic panel depicting a scene with multiple characters. A woman with purple hair and a pink hat, appearing surprised, says, "That's the boy of your dreams I conjured up."  Another woman with similar hair reacts with shock, exclaiming "Whaaat!?"  A third person, seemingly a man with white hair and dark clothing, appears to be using magic, creating a large blue energy blast. He is in disbelief and states, "I'm not dreaming of anything!!!" The scene includes various speech bubbles conveying surprise, disbelief and dialogue.  Later panels show the woman in the pink hat winking and talking secretively with another woman, hinting at a hidden location or secret.  The overall mood is one of surprise, intrigue, and magical events.
