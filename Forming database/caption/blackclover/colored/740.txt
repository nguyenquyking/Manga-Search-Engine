A bright, yellowish-white beam of light, possibly magical energy, explodes outwards, engulfing several figures in the foreground.  The figures are indistinct but appear to be people being propelled forward by the force.  In the top panel, a woman with long blonde hair and a single visible blue eye watches the event with a distressed expression.  The word "FWASH" is present above her.  In the bottom panel, two characters react in shock. The blond one, seemingly Asta, mouths "WHAT IN...?!!" in surprise.  Another shorter character with spiky hair is also visible, reacting with a fearful expression. The word "KRAKKADOOM" is present near the beam's base. The overall scene depicts a powerful magical attack or event with characters reacting to its sudden and intense force.
