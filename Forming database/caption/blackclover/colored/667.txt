Black Clover manga panel depicting a revelation about the curse magic.  A woman with dark hair and an eyepatch, possibly Asta's sister, is shown reacting to information about Megicula, the father of all curses, and how the curse magic of this world originated with her. Another panel shows Megicula, a purple-haired witch, explaining this.  The narrative focuses on the protagonist's discovery of the true way to use the cursed briars and how the curse was a shackle to her magic.  The panels include text detailing the character's thoughts and explanations of the curse's origins.
