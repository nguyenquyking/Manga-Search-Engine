Black Clover manga color spread depicting Licht's farewell.  Licht, with three red markings on his forehead, expresses regret but accepts death. He's surrounded by other characters, including a woman with pink hair and a man with white hair who express sadness.  Licht states he's leaving things to Licht (presumably another character), while reflecting on a fulfilling life fighting alongside others. The scene features dramatic black energy effects as Licht seemingly disappears or transforms.  The panel includes text indicating the scene is from the Color Clovers Team and a Twitter handle.
