Black Clover manga panels depicting a conversation between several characters.  A woman reveals that a member of a resistance force from the Spade Kingdom, opposing the Dark Triad, secretly visited the Clover Kingdom.  Another character, possibly Asta, is shown in a lower panel appearing surprised or questioning.  A third individual with a scar on his face is also shown, expressing disbelief ("Say what?!").  The scene is set in what looks like an official Clover Kingdom building.  The panels suggest a plot development related to the Spade Kingdom's resistance and their infiltration efforts.
