Black Clover manga panel depicting a map showing the Spade Kingdom, a large, snow-covered landmass dominated by a large castle.  The text describes the Spade Kingdom as a "mystery-filled winter country...the demon nation of Spade," emphasizing their supremacy achieved through harnessing ancient horrors.  A smaller panel features Asta, Noelle Silva, and a third character (possibly Mimosa Vermillion) reacting to the map and the expanding influence of the Spade Kingdom into the Clover Kingdom's territory.  The map also shows the Heart and Diamond Kingdoms.  The overall tone is one of impending conflict and threat.
