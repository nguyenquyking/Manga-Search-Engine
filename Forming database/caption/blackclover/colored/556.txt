A manga panel depicts Licita, a woman with short blonde hair and green eyes, interacting with a seemingly unconscious individual (possibly Asta) in a rustic room.  Licita expresses surprise at the person's awakening.  Another panel shows a larger, shadowy figure with red eyes, revealing a flashback related to their awakening. Licita demonstrates her magic by igniting firewood using a small bottle.  The scene emphasizes Licita's magical ability to manipulate mana and her welcoming of the unconscious individual to her home.  The overall tone is one of mystery and intrigue.
