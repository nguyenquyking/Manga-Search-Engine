A colossal, snow-covered ancient demon, with sharp horns and glowing red eyes, looms over a snow-covered town.  Three onlookers—two men and a woman—react with terror, mouths agape, their faces displaying fear and disbelief.  Another character, partially obscured, observes the scene with a grim expression and red-tinged eyes, seemingly accepting the overwhelming power.  The text highlights the demon's legendary status and the insignificance of emotion in the face of such overwhelming power.  The scene is one of impending doom and overwhelming scale.
