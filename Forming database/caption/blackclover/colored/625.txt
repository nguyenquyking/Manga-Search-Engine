Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple characters engaged in tense dialogue.  A blond character with a mask-like face expresses surprise ("Say what?!").  A dark-haired character declares his intention to sacrifice himself ("Sacrifice yourself for the sake of the people who are right").  Another scene shows several characters discussing Asta's arrival ("Will Asta really make it in time?").  A dark-haired character confidently asserts he will be the one to act ("That won't be you! It'll be me!!"), while another anticipates ending things before Asta arrives ("Except I'm going to end it all...").  A third dark-haired character dismisses the others ("It won't be you either...").  The overall mood is serious and dramatic, focusing on anticipation and conflicting intentions before a pivotal event.
