One man, with bloody scratches across his face, has blue eyes and black hair.  He is identified as the last Dark Triad member. The other, with white hair and purple eyes, also shows facial injuries and declares their intent to save Yami. The bottom panel shows a large, damaged arena where a battle is in progress.  Megicula, a powerful entity, is engaged in combat, with Asta present in the foreground.  The scene is labeled as "shortly before Megicula's defeat."
