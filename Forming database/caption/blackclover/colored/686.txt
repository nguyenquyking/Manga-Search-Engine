Black Clover manga panels depicting a powerful, dark-skinned antagonist with horns and a crown, seemingly manipulating blades on his body. He is shown expressing disdain ("That's just pathetic.") towards someone, possibly referring to another character who is only shown partially and is seemingly being threatened.  The antagonist is identified in the last panel as having been entertained by Yami Sukehiro, a former captain. The visual style is dark and intense, emphasizing the antagonist's power and menacing presence.  The panels show the antagonist's power in action and his dialogue reveals his arrogant demeanor and disregard for others.
