Black Clover manga color spread depicting a battle scene.  A powerful, monstrous entity with multiple limbs and glowing yellow energy attacks Asta, who is shown mid-air, deflecting the energy beams with his own magic.  Other panels show Lady Tetia lying injured, and a female character (possibly a Dark Triad member) explaining the situation, possibly regarding the creation and misuse of magic tools. The overall scene is chaotic and intense, filled with energy blasts and magical effects, with a large army of dark figures visible in the background.
