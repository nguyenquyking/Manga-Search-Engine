Black Clover manga panels depicting Noelle Silva and a water spirit. Noelle, possessing the traits to host the water spirit, is addressed by the spirit.  The spirit is initially displeased with Noelle, but Noelle's calm demeanor eventually appeases it.  A separate panel shows that a curse temporarily broke the contract between Noelle and her grimoire, necessitating a temporary move to another grimoire.
