This Black Clover fan art depicts two brothers, likely from the Veaude House, engaged in a tense confrontation. One brother, with light brown hair and green highlights, declares his ambition to become the head of the house, and to be acknowledged by his father.  The other brother, with similar brown hair but without green highlights, expresses anger and disbelief at his sibling's audacity and ambition,  considering him a talentless peasant.  The scene showcases the brothers' conflicting desires and rivalry for recognition within their family.  The artwork style resembles the original Black Clover manga.
