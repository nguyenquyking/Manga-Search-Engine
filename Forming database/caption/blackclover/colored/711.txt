This One Piece manga panel depicts multiple scenes.  The first shows a character, possibly Plumede, holding a small, demonic-looking purple cat.  The second shows a cloaked figure with dark hair and red eyes, sweating profusely, and requesting death. The third shows two characters engaged in a confrontation: a green-haired individual in a cage-like helmet displaying a surprised expression, and a skeletal-looking figure in dark armor.  The skeletal figure is speaking of inevitable death.  The text bubbles contain dialogue indicating threats and acceptance of death.
