Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene. Langris, with intense eyes and crimson hair, uses space-distorting magic, his hand glowing purple.  Another character, unseen but implied to be his opponent, is shown to be subjected to this attack. Text indicates Langris' magic gouges through space itself, while another character explains they boosted their speed using a mana method.  A third panel shows a dark-haired character with glowing red eyes deflecting or countering an attack with a large blade.  The text indicates their defenses will be ineffective.
