Black Clover manga color spread depicting multiple scenes and characters.  A blonde-haired character (likely Yuno) expresses faith rather than responsibility.  A man in a dark suit (possibly a high-ranking official) discusses a national crisis and the potential for judgement.  Another scene shows a small figure (potentially Asta) running away, observed by a man in priestly garb.  The overall tone is serious and concerned, focusing on a looming crisis and the weight of decisions.
