Black Clover manga page 204, "The Desire for Demise".  A woman with red hair, possibly a princess, and a man with brown hair, possibly a prince or king, are shown flying horizontally, hand-in-hand, at high speed.  The scene then shifts to a close-up of the woman's determined eye, with text indicating a vow to prevent a past tragedy from repeating. Finally, a sepia-toned illustration depicts a large Royal Palace 500 years prior, hinting at the beginning of a legend and revenge.
