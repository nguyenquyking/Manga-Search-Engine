A masked figure in dark purple clothing, possibly a high-ranking member, addresses a horned figure wearing a crown, seemingly a captain or leader.  The masked individual is speaking, stating "I'm talking with the captain over there," while the horned figure is shown being struck or attacked.  Another panel shows a close-up of the horned figureâ€™s face, exhibiting a sinister grin.  Impact sounds ("Krik," "Krak") are visually represented. The overall mood is intense and confrontational.
