Black Clover manga scene depicting a powerful display of magic.  A Dark Triad member reacts with shock and amusement ("DAMMIT!!," "Haw Haw") to a surprising event.  Three other characters (possibly Asta, Yuno, and another) express astonishment ("A great surprise").  The main focus is a massive summoning of devils ("The devils just keep pouring out"), viewed by a character with white hair and a red eye ("What a view...").  The scale of the devil summoning is emphasized by motion lines and visual effects.
