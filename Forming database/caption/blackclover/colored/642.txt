Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and an unnamed opponent.  Asta, with fiery orange hair, is shown using flame magic, stating "I will burn away...everything."  His opponent, a dark, shadowy figure with sharp teeth and horns, is amused, stating "This is fun!!!" and reflecting on their own strength ("That I could still get stronger!!!").  The scene suggests a battle; Asta's opponent appears significantly more powerful.  A third character, dark-haired and calm, observes Asta's battle, commenting on the opponent's suitability to test Asta's training.
