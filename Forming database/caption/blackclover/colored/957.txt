A Black Clover manga panel depicting Nozel Silva's distressed reaction to a curse affecting his mother.  He's shown with a serious expression, his long white hair framing his face.  The panel shows text detailing the curse's effects: revealing the truth about his mother's death will result in the curse spreading, and those who know will also be afflicted.  Nozel is determined to find a solution to save his mother, even if it means sacrificing himself.  Another panel depicts Nozel's mother in bed, seemingly ill.  The curse is visually represented by a dark, viral symbol.
