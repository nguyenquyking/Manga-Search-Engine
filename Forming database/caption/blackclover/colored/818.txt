Black Clover manga color illustration: Two characters confront each other.  The character on the left has a dark, shadowed face with sharp teeth, while the character on the right, with similar sharp teeth and red eyes, declares "It's called... fear!!!"  Below, a smaller panel shows a third character reacting with surprise ("OH!"). The final panel depicts a dynamic action scene with fiery energy and motion lines, suggesting a powerful attack or magic.  The overall tone is dark and intense.
