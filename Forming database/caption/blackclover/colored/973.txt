Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A colored manga panel depicts a conversation between several characters.  The first panel shows two women with dark hair, one expressing a sentiment of wanting deserved rewards, while the other states "That's reality," implying a harsh truth.  The next panel shows a distressed young woman with light purple hair and injuries, reacting with a "NO!!" to something unseen.  The final panel features a young man with blond hair witnessing a scene involving a man with dark hair and dark markings, emerging from a dark, shadowy space with mysterious, clawed hands.  The blond haired man appears concerned. An open book with illegible text is scattered on the floor, possibly related to the mysterious scene. The overall tone suggests conflict and injustice.
