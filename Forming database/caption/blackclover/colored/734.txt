Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A manga panel depicting a group navigating a magical, snow-filled landscape.  Several characters in dark cloaks stand amidst snowmen created by "Snow Creation Magic,"  forming a "Snowman Safehouse."  A blonde-haired character, possibly a mage, is prominently featured, gesturing towards an axolotl-like creature.  Other characters are seen being transported by similar creatures in the upper panel, expressing surprise ("Whoa!"). The scene is dynamic, blending fantastical elements with action and a sense of wonder.
