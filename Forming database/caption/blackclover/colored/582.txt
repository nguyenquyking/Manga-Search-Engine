Manga panel depicting a scene from Black Clover.  Several small, demonic creatures, glowing faintly, surround a person with dark hair, who is addressed as "Mister Nacht".  Another character, Asta, is shown in a separate panel, along with a smaller demonic creature, indicating a shared objective.  The dialogue reveals a disagreement about the nature of the ritual involving the demonic creatures; one character calls it "devil-friending", while another dismisses it as not being a "devil-binding" ritual, and considers the person summoning them a "moron". The overall tone is tense and mysterious.
