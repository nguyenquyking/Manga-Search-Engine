A manga panel depicting a young man's reflection on his life.  The top panel shows a close-up of a stern-looking eye, possibly belonging to an older figure. The following panels show: 1) the young man's father, a hunter, with a bow and quiver; 2) the young man manifesting his magic as glowing blue blades; 3) a scene featuring a rabbit, symbolizing his father's conventional hunting; 4) the young man using his magic to cut down insects (a praying mantis and a butterfly). The narrative focuses on the contrast between his father's simple hunting and the young man's powerful magic, leaving him questioning his future.  The overall mood is introspective and slightly melancholic.
