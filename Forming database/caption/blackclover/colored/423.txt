One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A character with dark hair and a tan top, possibly Asta (Black Clover, not One Piece), uses a dark-colored sword, creating a powerful, swirling, blue energy blast that shatters the surrounding earth. Another character, partially visible, is shown defending against this attack, sustaining damage and being thrown backward.  The scene is filled with motion lines indicating speed and force, and onomatopoeia such as "WHUD," "GNGRH!", "SWISH", "TCH!", and "HWOOO" depict the sounds of impact and movement.  The final panel shows a close-up of a blue energy effect and the word "SINGU-".
