One Piece manga panel depicting a perilous scene. A woman with dark hair, exhibiting signs of distress ("My body's, like... Creepy!"), is shown weakening.  A fiery, dragon-like entity, seemingly connected to her, is losing its luminescence ("The light's getting weaker...!!").  Simultaneously, another character with pink hair and distinctive facial markings observes a group of individuals near a glowing exit at the bottom floor, stating that the light connection will reveal their next course of action. The group appears to be seeking escape ("The exit at the bottom floor is our only hope...Let's hurry!!"). The overall tone suggests urgency and danger.
