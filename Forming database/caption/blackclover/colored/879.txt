Black Clover manga panel depicting Undine, a spirit, questioning a woman with silver hair about the "Saint Stage," a powerful magical state.  The woman explains that it purifies malice and destroys devils, attainable only by spirit hosts.  Another panel shows Vanica, possessing half of Megicula, the Supreme Devil.  The text suggests that while Arcane Stage mages could defeat Vanica, the Saint Stage offers another possibility, referencing the training of Fuegoleon and Yuno, who are also spirit hosts.  A green-skinned spirit is also shown.
