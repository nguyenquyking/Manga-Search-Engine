Black Clover manga panel depicting the Color Clovers' combined magic attack.  Shiuny's "Magic" is channeled through multiple members unleashing "True Flame," "True Wind," "True Plant," "True Cotton," "True Earth," "True Lightning," and "True Water" magic simultaneously, creating a powerful, multi-colored energy beam targeting a large, fluffy, seemingly magical creature (possibly a spirit or golem).  The attack is depicted with intense light and motion lines.
