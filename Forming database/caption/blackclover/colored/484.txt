Black Clover manga color spread featuring a smiling character, possibly a male, with dark hair tied back.  Speech bubbles indicate someone saying "I like you" and "You're a good person." The lower panels show a surprised, sweating character (possibly Asta) reacting with "Who the heck are you?!" and a close-up of Yami's forehead with a dark object embedded in it, with text indicating he's still alive.  The overall tone suggests a positive interaction followed by a scene of concern and surprise.
