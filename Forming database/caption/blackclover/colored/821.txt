A dramatic manga panel depicting Asta confronting a powerful, dark entity.  Asta, identifiable by his spiky, light-colored hair, is engaged in a fierce battle, seemingly overwhelmed by dark, purple energy emanating from his opponent.  The opponent is largely obscured, but its monstrous form and glowing red eyes are visible.  Speech bubbles reveal Asta's struggle ("...OFF THIS WORLD!!!") and the opponent's declaration ("...ARE A HUMAN AND DEVIL WHO HAVE NO MAGIC AT ALL.").  The scene is filled with intense energy effects and dynamic lines, emphasizing the power of the confrontation.  The visual style is dark and intense, with a focus on contrasting light and shadow.
