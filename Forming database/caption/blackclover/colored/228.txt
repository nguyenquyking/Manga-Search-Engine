A manga panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A man with dark hair and a smirk, smoking a cigarette, speaks to the viewer.  Text bubbles indicate he's referring to a group of "pitch black" individuals.  Another panel shows a young person, seemingly injured, to whom the man appears to be speaking.  A third panel shows Nero, a young woman with dark hair and horns, displaying glowing rings.  A final panel shows a pair of hands in handcuffs holding a book of spells.  The overall scene implies a passing of the torch or legacy, with a focus on the acceptance of a new generation.
