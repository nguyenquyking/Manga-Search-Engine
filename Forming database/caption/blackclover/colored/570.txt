The character experiences a sense of floating in empty space.  The main panel features a close-up of an eye, suggesting distress.  Smaller panels show the character's internal rage and hatred towards unspecified "devils," with repeated phrases such as "Kill!", "I hate them!", "I'm gonna kill them!", and variations emphasizing revenge and unforgiveness.  The overall mood is dark and intense, conveying feelings of anger and confinement.
