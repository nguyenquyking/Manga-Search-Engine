Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta's struggle with a dark entity.  Asta's body is immobile, shown through his wide, fearful eyes.  A female character, Rouge, is shown casting magic, pleading, "PLEASE!!", while a small, dark cat-like creature is encircled in pink magic.  Smaller panels show a previous battle scene and text indicating Asta's inability to control his magic due to his weakness.  The overall tone is intense and dramatic.
