Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  A male character, seemingly floating without using magic, is centrally featured. He's dressed in a dark, ornate outfit with gold accents, and holds a book.  Water magic, specifically a "Sea Dragon's Nest," is being used nearby, creating a large wave. Another character, with green hair, reacts with surprise. A third character, partially visible, expresses disbelief. The text indicates the team is Color Clovers and the art is by shawnfrostmaxll. The scene suggests a magical confrontation or display of power.
