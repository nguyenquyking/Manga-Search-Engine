A manga panel depicts a conversation between two characters.  One, a young man, is praised for his strength and dependability, described as the best partner anyone could ask for.  The other character, a woman, expresses sadness at being unable to help, but acknowledges his resilience and importance to the kingdom.  The young man is called an "idiot" but also the closest thing to a true magic knight. The scene also shows the woman feeding the young man a large pastry.  The dialogue reveals a close, if somewhat strained, relationship.  Visual elements include speech bubbles, action lines, and detailed character expressions.
