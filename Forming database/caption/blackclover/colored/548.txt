Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a character with spiky white hair and a black headband, appearing strained and sweating.  He's beside another character in dark clothing.  A third character, with dark hair and intense eyes, speaks, questioning Asta's strength gain.  The dialogue boxes reveal a time constraint of two days and imply Asta's unconventional methods for achieving strength.  The lower panel shows a close-up of a monstrous, fanged creature, possibly a manifestation of dark magic, accompanied by motion lines suggesting intense action or power.  The scene suggests conflict and a test of Asta's abilities.
