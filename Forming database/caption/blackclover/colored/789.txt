Two monstrous figures, seemingly embodying ice and fire, are depicted in intense confrontation.  The ice creature, on the left, is pale blue with sharp teeth and glowing red eyes, making pained sounds ("Guh-", "Good, good..."). The fire creature, on the right, is predominantly orange and white, also with sharp teeth and glowing red eyes, exhibiting sounds of distress ("Ah.", "Ahhh.", "Ah!").  Both figures are severely strained, with text indicating the agony and despair of their source ("...wrung from the straining throat of a human...", "Screams of agony and despair..."). The scene suggests a powerful, destructive struggle reaching its climax ("...until at last, he's... empty.", "...until the very end...").  The overall tone is one of intense suffering and finality.
