A Black Clover manga panel depicting a tense confrontation between Liebe (a demon) and a female character (likely Noelle Silva).  Liebe is absorbing Noelle's magic, as indicated by the red energy emanating from Liebe and Noelle's strained expression. Noelle fiercely resists, shouting, "Get out! Get away from Liebe!!!" and later, "...I'm not letting go!!!!"  Liebe counters with, "Who do you think you are ?!" and "Foolish human. Even if I'm nearly powerless here, a nobody like you could never..."  The scene suggests a power struggle with high stakes.  A smaller panel shows Noelle seemingly concentrating or preparing for further action.
