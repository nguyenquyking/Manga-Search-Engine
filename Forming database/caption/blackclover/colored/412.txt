Black Clover manga scene depicting a powerful magic explosion.  A Dark Disciple, Vanica, detonates a curse bomb infused with devil power.  She is shown smiling triumphantly while a shocked blonde-haired character (likely Asta or another Black Bull) observes the swelling magic.  The explosion's impact is shown on Vanica, her body visibly affected.  Another panel shows a wide shot of a town under attack.  The overall scene is one of high tension and impending disaster.
