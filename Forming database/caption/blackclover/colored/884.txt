A colored manga panel depicting two female characters, Noelle and another character (unnamed), engaged in a conversation.  Noelle, with light purple hair styled in twintails with purple ribbons, is expressing disbelief and anger, questioning the notion that kindness and affection can be mistakes. The other character, with long, flowing light blue hair, appears sorrowful and contemplative.  The background suggests an outdoor setting. The dialogue focuses on the concept of kindness, a past action (not telling about the Saint Stage), and the charactersâ€™ contrasting perspectives on their relationship.
