Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A colorized manga panel depicts a scene where a male character with dark hair and a dark outfit uses a magic spell.  A small, light-haired female character is shown launching a projectile of ice magic.  Another woman with orange hair and green eyes observes, appearing surprised. A third male figure,  wearing a light colored robe and carrying a chain of runes, is seen running away from a powerful beam of light. The text bubbles indicate the magic is tracking its target and the orange-haired woman is questioning the nature of the magic used. The style suggests a battle scene with magical abilities.
