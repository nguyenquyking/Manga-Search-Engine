Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and his devil form, Liebe. Asta, in a chibi-like style, is being carried piggyback by Liebe, whose devilish form is prominent, with multiple arms and dark, demonic features.  Asta is expressing surprise/excitement.  Text bubbles indicate an argument, with Asta being called a "90 percent idiot" for complaining.  The background shows a dark, gothic-style architectural setting.  The overall mood is action-packed and humorous.
