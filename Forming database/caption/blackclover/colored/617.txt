Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a cloaked figure, possibly a powerful antagonist. Asta, appearing injured and surprised, is seen on the ground. The cloaked figure, radiating dark, blue magical energy, stands imposingly.  The antagonist's magic seemingly nullified Asta's magic, indicated by text boxes detailing the effects of the antagonist's anti-magic.  The visual style is dark and dramatic, with emphasis on the antagonist's power and Asta's vulnerable state.  The panels also show close-ups of the antagonist's hand and face.
