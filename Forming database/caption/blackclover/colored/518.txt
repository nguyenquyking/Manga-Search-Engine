Black Clover manga scene depicting multiple characters and their actions.  A blonde female character, possibly Licht, concentrates mana, stating, "â€¦so we can take down that bony jerk!!!" and "I'm storing up mana over here...".  Yuno, with green mana flowing around him, is shown in another panel,  the text stating "...is through losing!!!"  and "Yuno...". Asta, looking concerned, is seen in a separate panel stating, "I don't hate people like you." Another dark-haired character observes, "All right," and "It does look like he has a chance, at least." The scene showcases a magical battle, with focus on mana usage and character interactions.
