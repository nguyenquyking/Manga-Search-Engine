A colorized manga panel depicts a dynamic battle scene. Asta, wielding his anti-magic sword, attacks two figures engulfed in flames and ice, respectively.  The flames and ice clash violently, creating a visually striking effect.  Asta's attacks are depicted with motion lines and onomatopoeia, such as "FUASH" and "CREC."  The opponents question Asta's ability to hit them ("Can you hit us?"), highlighting their seemingly intangible forms.  A final panel shows a character, possibly injured, with blood on their face, accompanied by the text "Their physical bodies vanished!!" suggesting the opponents' ability to evade attacks.  The overall scene is chaotic and energetic, emphasizing the power and speed of the combat.
