Black Clover manga panel depicting a discussion about the Clover Kingdom's overthrow by foreign lands.  A young prince, possibly Licht, looks concerned at a map showing the kingdom's territorial loss.  Other characters present include a woman with purple hair, a woman with black hair and horns, and a man smoking, potentially Yami Sukehiro, alongside Asta who displays a shocked expression.  The dialogue boxes indicate speculation about the involvement of the Diamond Kingdom and another unnamed kingdom in the takeover.
