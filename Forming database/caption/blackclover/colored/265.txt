A young woman with lavender hair, wearing a pink witch's outfit, sits in a pink armchair within a whimsical, dream-like space.  She is identified as the creator of this "Glamour World," a space isolated from the outside world and operating under her rules.  The world is filled with floating sweets, toys, and furniture, including a donut, stuffed animals, and a chair. In a separate panel, another character is shown falling into this dream world, exclaiming "Hya!!".  The scene showcases a magical, candy-like environment indicative of a dream or illusion.
