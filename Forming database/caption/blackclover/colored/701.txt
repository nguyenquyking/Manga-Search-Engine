A dramatic manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  A dark-haired character with large, dark, horned wings, possibly a devil fruit user, unleashes a powerful, glowing green energy attack. This character is central to the image.  In the background, three figures—one dark-skinned and two with smaller, glowing wings (one blue, one red)—face off in a confrontation. The scene is set against a dark, brick-like background with red tones suggesting fire or intense energy.  The overall style is dynamic, with motion lines indicating the force of the attacks.  The word "KRAKKADOOM" is visible amongst the action. A shadowy figure with horns is visible in a lower panel, seemingly impacted by the blast.
