A manga-style image depicts a battle scene. A dark-haired character, possibly a sorceror, is shown falling to the ground, engulfed in flames and icy shards.  Their spell, depicted as dark, shadowy magic, is breaking.  Text bubbles indicate the character's shock ("Impossible!!", "They broke my spell? Something which doesn't physically exist?!") and the opponent's use of magic ("Their Magic...").  The visual style is dramatic, with intense color contrasts and motion lines suggesting force and impact.  The artist's tags "@ColorClovers" and "@NixkSenpai" are visible.
