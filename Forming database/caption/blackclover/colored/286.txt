Black Bulls' hideout is shown engulfed in dark purple flames, identified as "Black Oil Creation Magic" and described as curses deeply rooted and atrocious.  A map-like display shows the extent of the magical flames spreading across the land.  Characters present include Asta, who appears shocked,  a Black Bull member with gray hair, and another with teal hair, both observing the magical phenomenon.  A figure in a top hat, possibly a mage, is shown in the first panel, seemingly manipulating the magic. The scene depicts a large-scale magical event with potentially devastating consequences.
