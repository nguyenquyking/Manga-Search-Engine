Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a male character with dark hair, stating he's "TAKIN' A DUMP," while another male character observes, commenting on the urgency of the situation.  The second panel features a female character with a crown, reacting with unexpected sympathy.  A third panel shows Asta and another Black Bull member reacting with surprise. A fourth panel shows Mimosa holding a golden object, apparently a communication device, explaining she borrowed it to contact Marx.  The visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga.
