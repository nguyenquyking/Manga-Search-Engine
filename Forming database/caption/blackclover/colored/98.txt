He's positioned below Iceberry, who is moving at high speed, leaving a trail of light green energy.  Iceberry appears to be wielding a weapon or magic, indicated by the swirling energy around them.  The background is filled with motion lines and red splatter, suggesting a high-intensity battle.  A speech bubble from Iceberry questions Asta's ability to reach them at such speed, while another bubble from Iceberry comments on Asta's vigor. The overall scene is fast-paced and action-oriented.
