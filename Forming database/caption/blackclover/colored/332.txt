Black Clover manga scene depicting the Omniscient Priestess, a beautiful, harmoniously dressed woman in a flowing blue gown and crown, holding a blue book.  Text indicates her irreplaceable nature and vulnerability to a devil's curse.  A separate panel shows Asta, surprised and blushing, reacting to a cleaned-up woman (possibly the Priestess, though not explicitly shown) being described as pretty. Another woman with black hair and red eyes is also present.  A swirling, destructive force is shown affecting a person in a blue dress, possibly related to the curse.
