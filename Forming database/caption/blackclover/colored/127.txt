Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A monstrous, dark-red creature, seemingly composed of multiple smaller entities, confronts a character wielding a glowing teal-green magic blade.  The creature calls the blade wielder a "lowly human" and boasts about utilizing the powers of spirits and elves against their magic. The blade wielder counters that the opponent is merely a "walking corpse," and while acknowledging support limitations, declares their opponent's magic won't pierce their heart.  The overall color scheme is vibrant, with contrasting dark reds and bright teal-greens dominating the scene.  The text indicates a power struggle between anti-magic and spirit/elf-based magic.
