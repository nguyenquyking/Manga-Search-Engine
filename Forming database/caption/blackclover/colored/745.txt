One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Several demonic, low-ranking creatures with red eyes and dark, spiky features are shown fighting and scrambling to escape. One larger creature is seen playfully tossing a smaller one,  saying "Let's play catch."  Another panel shows Asta and a blonde woman observing the scene from a distance, with a man in the background stating that these devils are stronger than previous ones. The overall tone is chaotic and violent.
