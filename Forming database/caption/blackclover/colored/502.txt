The scene features Asta and a light-haired character in the foreground, discussing the power levels of the devils.  A dark-haired character, possibly a villain, listens intently, smirking.  Text clarifies that the upper devils are equals to the Dark Triad, while lower devils are even more powerful.  The visual style is sharp with bold lines and red color scheme emphasizing the devil hierarchy.
