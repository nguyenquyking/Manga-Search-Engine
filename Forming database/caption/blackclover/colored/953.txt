Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  **Black Clover manga panels depict Asta, in a powerful, blue energy form, confronting a dark entity.  Asta's opponent, possibly a powerful demon or dark magic user, is partially obscured, with only dark, clawed hands visible.  Asta is accompanied by a wounded Yuno, in his golden, grimoire-powered form, who is shown in both panels.  Dialogue bubbles indicate Asta's readiness for battle ("Let's do this!!") and Yuno's acknowledgement ("Right...").  The scene is dynamic, filled with motion lines and energy effects, signifying a powerful confrontation.**
