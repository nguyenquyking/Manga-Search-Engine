Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta in his Devil Union form, showcasing his immense power.  Asta's red demonic eyes and sharp teeth are prominent.  He is positioned powerfully, facing a woman with long dark hair, whose face is partially visible and shows blood dripping from her mouth.  The woman appears distressed.  Text bubbles indicate Asta is demonstrating his strength, and the womanâ€™s inner thoughts are suggested.  A subsequent panel shows Asta's back, large devil wings spread, facing another woman in a light-colored robe, implying a confrontation or a display of power.  The overall tone is dramatic and action-oriented.
