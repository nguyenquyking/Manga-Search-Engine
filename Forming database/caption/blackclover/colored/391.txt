A female character, possibly a sorceress or mage, unleashes a powerful dark purple and red energy surge.  She is centrally positioned,  wearing dark clothing and holding an open book.  The energy emanating from her forms large, clawed appendages. Text indicates she's using 70% of her power.  A separate panel shows a mermaid-like character falling through water.  Another panel shows a close-up of a shocked, screaming female face, suggesting the impact of the energy surge. The overall tone is one of intense magical power and impending danger.
