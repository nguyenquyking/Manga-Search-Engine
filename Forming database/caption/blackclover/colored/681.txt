Black Clover manga scene depicting a confrontation.  A horned, crowned figure (likely a devil or powerful antagonist) laughs maniacally, while a cloaked figure (likely Shiuny) struggles to land a decisive blow, stating their inability to kill him.  The crowned figure challenges Shiuny to keep them entertained until a gate opens.  In a separate panel, another character, possibly Jack, is shown on the ground, while another character observes, commenting on their "boring" demeanor and referring to the fallen character as "Captain".  The overall scene is characterized by intense action and dark, dramatic visuals.
