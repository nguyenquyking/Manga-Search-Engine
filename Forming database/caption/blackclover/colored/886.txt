Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  Noelle Silva uses ice magic (blue), while Vanica Zogratis, in a red dress, unleashes a powerful, blood-red, energy-based attack.  A third character, possibly a male, is also attacking, emitting yellow energy. Vanica taunts Noelle and the other attacker, encouraging them to continue fighting.  The scene is dynamic, with intense energy effects and dramatic speech bubbles emphasizing the battle's intensity.
