Black Clover manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  A bloodied Asta, eyes wide, is the central focus, his expression a mix of determination and weariness.  Speech bubbles indicate Asta's opponent (unseen except for a partially visible hooded figure) is expressing remorse for doubting Asta.  Asta is shown to have a five-leaf grimoire.  Another panel shows a woman with dark hair and red eyes, seemingly reacting to the events unfolding.  The overall tone is intense and suggests a significant turning point in the battle.
