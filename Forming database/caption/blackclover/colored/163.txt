Black Clover manga color spread depicting the aftermath of a powerful magic spell.  Multiple panels show a blonde-haired character, possibly a captain, witnessing the transformation of a luminous figure into multiple smaller ones dispersing across the sky. Other characters observe the event, some appearing awestruck. A large explosion or magical effect is seen in the final panel, possibly connected to the initial luminous figure. The text suggests the event is significant and possibly life-saving, possibly tied to the "Golden Dawn's Captain."  Children are shown looking upwards in wonder.  The overall mood is one of awe and relief.
