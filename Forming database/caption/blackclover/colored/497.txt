Black Clover manga scene depicting a meeting of powerful figures.  Several devils, including large, horned, shadowy entities, are present.  A man with dark hair and a dark cloak sits centrally, seemingly the host.  Other attendees include a man in white robes, a man in green robes, a woman in silver armor, and a man in purple robes. Asta, with his signature anti-magic grimoire, is shown reacting with shock in a separate panel, along with another character whose face is partially obscured by a mask.  The text bubbles indicate surprise and disbelief at the presence of multiple devils.
