One Piece Manga:  Nochii, a dark-haired woman adorned with a jeweled necklace, performs a powerful sealing magic, "Eternal Prison," using forbidden magic and magic stones.  She shows disregard for the backlash. The magic creates a dark, ominous seal, trapping a shadowy entity. Another character, a smaller, light-haired figure, possibly a child, interacts with the magic stones, seemingly aiding or opposing Nochii. The scene emphasizes the dark and powerful nature of Nochii's magic, highlighting the potential consequences of its use.  The text implies the magic's power is significant even if used by those without mana.
