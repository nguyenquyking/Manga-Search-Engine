Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  A blonde male character expresses surprise and compliments a dark-haired female character, Nero, who appears in a dark dress.  Another scene shows two characters, one blonde and one with short, dark hair, observing a figure in a white cloak in a distant landscape.  Text bubbles indicate the characters are discussing Nero's presence and an otherworldly magic power emanating from the Shadow Palace. The image is digitally colored, and the style is consistent with the Black Clover anime.
