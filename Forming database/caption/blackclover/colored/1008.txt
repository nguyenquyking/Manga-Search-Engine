A colored manga panel depicts a battle scene.  A character with bright green hair, possibly Asta from Black Clover, is severely wounded and bleeding profusely, having narrowly avoided a fatal blow.  His opponent, a dark-clothed figure with antlers and chains, is shown in a prior panel, having launched an attack.  The narrative text reveals Asta narrowly missed a fatal blow aimed at the heart, having diverted the attack to protect a comrade.  Multiple speed lines and impact effects emphasize the intensity of the attack and Asta's injuries.  The color scheme contrasts the vibrant green of Asta's hair and clothing with the dark, ominous presence of his opponent and the deep purple and blue hues of the background.
