A manga panel depicting a fierce confrontation.  A character with dark hair, sharp teeth, and glowing red eyes (likely a devil or demon) is shown in a close-up, menacingly addressing an unseen opponent.  The character's dialogue reads, "You'd better show me a good time!!".  The background shows powerful energy blasts radiating outwards, depicted with red and black lines suggestive of speed and force; a light blue sphere is at the epicenter of this energy.  Another speech bubble shows the opponent's response: "I'm not gonna forgive you if you let this end fast!!".  The overall scene suggests a high-stakes battle with intense energy and impending danger.
