Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a tall, dark-haired man in ornate, gold-accented clothing (likely a high-ranking individual) addresses a group.  He explains the existence of five Tier 0 Spirit Guardians who will strengthen those chosen. A woman with long white hair and striking blue eyes follows, announcing that after six months of training, they will attack a demon together.  The woman's declaration is directed at Asta, Noelle Silva,  Yuno, Mimosa Vermillion, and Magna Swing.  They stand in formation, ready to begin training. The overall mood is serious and determined, setting up a major battle arc.
