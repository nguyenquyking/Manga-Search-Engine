Black Clover manga scene depicting a magical confrontation.  A character with silver hair, seemingly casting a spell, observes a central figure with purple hair and dark clothing being affected by a purple energy beam.  Another silver-haired individual looks on. A third character, light-haired, is shown experiencing a powerful magical effect, possibly the result of the spell. The narrative text boxes indicate the spell is only usable on people the caster has known for a long time, and that the targeted individual unexpectedly fulfills the spell's conditions.
