Black Clover manga color illustration depicting a battle scene.  A severely strained Asta, his body at its limit, is shown in the top panel.  Below, Yami Sukehiro and a young Licht (possibly a flashback or alternate reality version) are shown determinedly vowing to "save their comrades."  In the final panel, a distressed young Asta observes a battle from afar, recognizing the "anti-magic boy" he fights alongside. The scene highlights desperation and resolve in the face of overwhelming odds.
