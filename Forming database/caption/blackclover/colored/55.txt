Black Clover manga scene depicting Asta's shocked reaction as he confronts a powerful demon.  Asta and other characters are shown flying through the air, amidst a flurry of dark, spiky energy.  The demon, with glowing red eyes, is a major visual element.  Text bubbles express Asta's surprise ("What the hell is going on?!") and the demon's recognition of Asta after a 500-year absence ("It can't be...to think I'd be able to meet you again!" and "It's been 500 long years, demon..."). The scene suggests a climactic confrontation.
