Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A dynamic manga panel depicts a fierce battle. Multiple dark-cloaked figures, possibly representing a single entity or a group of similar beings, unleash a flurry of icy, light-blue attacks amidst fiery orange explosions.  The figures appear to be using powerful magic or ki-based abilities. The word "FUOOOH" appears multiple times, indicating the force of the attacks.  In a smaller panel below, a character (possibly the antagonist) with dark hair and a grim expression shouts "IMODO: EQUUS!", initiating or enhancing the attack. Another panel shows a close-up of a pale, horned, demonic-looking figure, also involved in the conflict. The overall scene is chaotic and energetic, suggesting a powerful and intense confrontation.
