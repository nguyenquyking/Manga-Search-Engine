A powerful energy blast, possibly a Haki-infused attack, collides with a large, glowing orb.  A dark-clad figure, possibly a villain, is seen launching the attack from the right, while a smaller figure in dark clothing is shown being flung to the left by the force of the impact.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia (SKASH, VWA). The orb shows signs of shattering from the impact.  The overall style suggests a manga or anime depiction of a battle scene.
