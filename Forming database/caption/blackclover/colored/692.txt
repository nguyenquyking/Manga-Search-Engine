Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, in a shadowed, demonic form, engaging in intense combat within a grand, ancient-looking building.  Asta's opponent is partially obscured but appears dark and powerful.  Asta is emitting powerful energy, indicated by bright lines radiating from him.  In the upper panel, a close-up of a grinning, scarred face, possibly Asta's transformed face, is shown with the text "SHAD-DUP!!!" and "JUST DIE ALREADY!!!".  Lower panels show other characters' reactions;  one appears to be a female character with a surprised expression and another is a character with light green hair, also looking surprised, expressing the thought "WHAT IS THIS FEELING...?!!".  The overall scene suggests a climactic battle with high stakes.
