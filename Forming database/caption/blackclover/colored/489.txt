Black Clover manga page 262 depicts a turbulent conference.  Several characters are present, including a young man with blond hair seated at a table (possibly Asta's brother, Noelle), and a group standing behind a long table.  Among those standing are:  a man with white hair and a large white fur collar, a woman in a pink hat, a person with green wings and a bare torso, a man in a red and white military-style coat, a woman in blue and white armor, and two older men, one with purple robes and a mustache and another in a red robe. The scene is set in an ornate room.  Close-ups of a blond-haired young man and a man with dark hair and golden eyes are also included.
