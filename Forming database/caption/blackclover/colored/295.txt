A Black Clover manga panel depicting Noelle Silva (blonde hair, in a light-colored dress) recounting a past trip to the Heart Kingdom at age 13 with her brother.  She's shown reflecting on the experience,  mentioning abundant water, greenery, and mana.  A separate panel shows Asta, Noelle, and Mimosa Vermillion seated around a table, with Noelle explaining her visit. Another panel displays a younger Noelle joyfully experiencing the Heart Kingdom's advanced magic technology, which differed from the Clover Kingdom's.  The overall scene conveys Noelle's past experiences and their relevance to the current situation with Asta.
