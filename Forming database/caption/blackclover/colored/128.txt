Black Clover manga scene depicting a fast-paced battle.  Characters are straining, with one (likely Asta) shouting "AND GO EVEN FASTER!!" while showing intense exertion. Another character, partially visible, states, "WE'LL DRAW EACH OTHER CLOSER," suggesting a collaborative strategy.  The background shows dark, shadowy figures and glowing green energy trails, indicating magical attacks or abilities. The text reveals that enemies are hidden within the shadows of previously used magic. The scene is dynamic and intense, focusing on the characters' effort and the strategic nature of the fight.  The art style is consistent with Black Clover's manga style.
