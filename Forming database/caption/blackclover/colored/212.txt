Black Clover manga panel depicting a trial scene.  Several robed figures fire colored energy blasts at a young girl, labeled "Guilty," standing in a central platform. Asta, visibly shocked, reacts in the adjacent panel. A dark-skinned man accuses the girl of being evil.  The overall scene suggests a magical judgment or execution.
