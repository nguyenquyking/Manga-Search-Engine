Manga panel depicting a confrontation between Nacht Faust and Bell.  Bell, a winged fairy-like figure in a light green dress, is shown in a dynamic pose, her wings spread wide.  She says, "Bell," and "Right!!!" Nacht Faust, a dark-haired man with horns and dark clothing, is shown in a lower panel, appearing from the shadows. He addresses Bell as a "Bony Loser".  The overall color scheme is predominantly green, contrasting with the darker tones of Nacht's section. Speed lines and sound effects emphasize movement and action.
