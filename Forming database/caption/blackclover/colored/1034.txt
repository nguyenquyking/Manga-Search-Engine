A demonic figure, possibly a Devil or a powerful antagonist, with horns and glowing blue eyes, declares his intent: "â€¦to crush you."  The second panel shows a dramatic battle scene.  A character, possibly a warrior or angel, clad in light green and wearing a crown, fights back using a glowing green sword against the demonic figure's attack, which resembles a large, spiky, dark structure emanating from the antagonist. The scene is chaotic and filled with sharp, broken structures suggesting a destructive battle.  The color palette is dark, with teal and green highlights contrasting against the grey and black tones.
