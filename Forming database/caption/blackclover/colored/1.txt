Black Clover manga page 202, "A Different World," depicts a battle scene.  A demonic figure, possibly a devil or high-ranking demon, is severely wounded, its body partially obscured by red and black energy effects.  The demon states, "You cut me quite well!"  A separate panel shows a character's eye, seemingly recovering from an attack, with the word "RECOVER" emphasized. Another panel shows the demon's upper body, with the sound effect "HN HN HN" indicating pain or exertion.  The top panel suggests an earlier attack, with a figure (possibly Asta) appearing to successfully land a blow.  The overall color palette is predominantly dark red and black, highlighting the intense nature of the battle.
