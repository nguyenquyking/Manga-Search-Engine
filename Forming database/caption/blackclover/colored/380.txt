A colored manga panel depicting a powerful water magic attack.  A female character, possibly a mage, is shown in the lower panel, her expression fierce.  She's using "Water Spirit Magic: Ludic Sanctuary," a technique combining "Mana Zone + Mana Method," to create a massive swirling vortex of water that engulfs another character (partially visible in the lower right) whose blood magic is being neutralized.  The text indicates the water magic is cutting the opponent's power in half.  The scene is dynamic and visually impactful, emphasizing the power of the water magic.
