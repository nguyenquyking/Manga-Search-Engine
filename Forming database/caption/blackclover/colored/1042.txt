Yuno, with bright green spiky hair and bloody face, achieves the Saint Stage.  The image shows Yuno's intense expression and a glowing green, sword-like object emanating from him.  Narrative text boxes describe the process of achieving this stage, requiring near-perfect resonance between a spirit and its host, achieved through near-death combat.  Smaller panels depict multiple colored energy sources and a past battle scene.
