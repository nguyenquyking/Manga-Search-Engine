Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  Top panel shows two characters, likely mages, being carried on a wind current. One says "Let me handle the rest," and the other is told to find a recovery mage. A green-haired character, possibly a magic user, thanks them for arriving in time.  The middle panel shows a blonde-haired character in shock beside a wounded, scowling, light-haired male character.  The blonde character exclaims about a four-leaf grimoire and a second grimoire. The bottom panel shows close-ups of the wounded light-haired male character, identified as the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn, and the green-haired character, both bloodied but seemingly victorious.
