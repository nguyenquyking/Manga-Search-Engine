A Black Clover manga panel depicts a battle scene.  A character with dark hair and intense eyes, possibly a powerful magic user, prepares an attack.  Multiple purple energy projectiles labeled "KRUNKL" emanate from him, targeting a distant figure who appears to be fighting back. The distant figure is smaller, seemingly male, with dark hair, and is shown mid-air, suggesting a magical or acrobatic maneuver.  The background is a landscape with a stream, showing the scale of the attack. Text boxes reveal the attacker's intent to inflict serious damage ("I think I'll tear off a leg or two, at least.") and another character's observation that the attacker's continued survival ensures their success ("As long as you're alive, we'll have what we need.").  The overall style is dynamic, emphasizing the power of the attack and the urgency of the situation.
