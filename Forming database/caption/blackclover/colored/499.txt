Black Clover manga panel depicting a meeting.  Several characters are present:  a woman with dark hair in a purple robe, two individuals (possibly a couple) in white cloaks, a man with spiky white hair, and a dark-haired man with horns.  The scene shifts between a discussion about a missing person ("That man is gone."), the use of magic, and a call to order to address the main topic due to time constraints.  The overall tone suggests urgency and seriousness.
