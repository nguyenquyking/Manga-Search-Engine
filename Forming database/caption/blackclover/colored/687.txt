A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character with green hair and sharp, pointed features, possibly a villain, uses a bright green energy attack,  labeled "Ribbons", to slash an opponent. The attack is depicted with bright green energy lines and the onomatopoeia "SLASH THEM TO RIBBONS."  The villain's expression is one of confident malice.  The target of the attack, partially visible in another panel, appears to be a dark, horned figure, possibly a demon or another fighter, who is being sliced through with the same green energy. Text indicates the attack is piercing through gravity.  The overall tone suggests a powerful and violent confrontation.
