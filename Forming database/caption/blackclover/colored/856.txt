One Piece manga panel depicting a fierce battle. A character, seemingly the antagonist, is unleashing a powerful blast ("I'm gonna blast you to smithereens, loser!!!") at another character, who is partially obscured by the impact.  The attacker's attack is depicted with dark, energetic lines and an explosion of light. The defending character, shown in a smaller panel below, responds with "Nice try!", suggesting they've withstood the attack or are preparing a counter-attack.  The scene is rendered in a dark and gritty style, emphasizing the intensity of the combat.  The word "Doom" appears twice in the background, adding to the ominous atmosphere.
