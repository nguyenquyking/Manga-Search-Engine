Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta lying on the floor in a library, surrounded by a glowing, light blue magical energy emanating from a small, square object.  The energy has a snowflake-like pattern.  Asta appears injured, with visible scratches on his face. Above him, a large ornate book with a spade symbol on its cover is shown.  Asta's expression is one of pained determination or anger. The text "MOIREâ€¦!!" is visible, likely a shout or exclamation.  Another text bubble contains "A GR...", suggesting a word or phrase is cut off. The scene suggests a magical event or attack has just occurred.
