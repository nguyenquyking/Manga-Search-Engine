Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, Nacht, and a third character (possibly a new ally). Asta, enthusiastically says "Yessir!!!",  reacting to Nacht's invitation. Nacht, in his devil-like form, is seen inviting the third character to join them. The third character, with dark hair pulled back, appears to be considering the offer.  Small devil-like creatures are shown in a lower panel, with speech bubbles expressing fear. The overall scene suggests a recruitment or alliance-building moment within a dark, possibly demonic context.
