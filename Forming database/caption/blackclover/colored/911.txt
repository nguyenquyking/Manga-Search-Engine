A manga panel depicting a scene from Black Clover.  A figure, seemingly Asta, confronts a massive, multi-headed blue hydra labeled "Hydra of Darkneros."  The hydra is surrounded by dark, swirling water, with "Devil Water Magic" prominently displayed above.  A smaller panel shows a woman with dark, almost demonic features, stating she "tinkered with the curse" and made someone a devil. Another panel shows a distressed, light-haired woman in a blue dress, reacting with horror. The overall scene is dark and ominous, suggesting a magical battle.
