One Piece manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A character, possibly a woman, with light-colored hair and wings, attacks with blue, water-like magic, shouting "I'll defeat you right this-".  Her attack is countered by a dark, purple, curse-warding magic, labeled "Curse-Warding Magic: Decaying World," emanating from a cloaked figure. The spell's effect is described as beyond comparison to its previous state. The scene features dynamic motion lines and impactful visual effects illustrating the clash of magic.  The word "vanished" appears in a panel depicting the dissipation of a previous spell.
