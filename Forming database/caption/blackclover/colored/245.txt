A colored manga panel depicting several scenes featuring Charlotte and Yami.  The first panel shows Charlotte blushing and visibly distressed, stating her inability to remain calm in the same room as Yami.  Another panel shows Yami, seemingly recovering, and Charlotte expressing concern for his well-being.  A subsequent panel depicts a conversation between Yami and another female character, possibly acknowledging a debt for saving them.  The final panel shows Yami smoking and advising Charlotte against overexertion, while also commenting on her "stubborn" and "clumsy" nature. The overall theme is post-battle recovery and interaction between the characters.
