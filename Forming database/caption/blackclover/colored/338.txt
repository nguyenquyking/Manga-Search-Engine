Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and Nero.  Asta, with green eyes, is addressed as "Dark-Tier" due to his immense, incomprehensible anti-magic power.  Nero, possessing forbidden and sealing magic, is also noted for their powerful abilities.  A separate panel shows a conversation between Asta and a female character, possibly Noelle, objecting to a decision being made on their behalf.  Another female character, possibly Sister Lily, offers knowledge in exchange for Asta and Nero's combined power to defeat a demon.  The visual style is consistent with the Black Clover manga, featuring distinct character designs and dynamic speech bubbles.
