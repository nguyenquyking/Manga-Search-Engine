One Piece manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters and actions.  A man in a white coat, possibly a scientist, levitates in a large, futuristic library filled with glowing bookshelves,  accelerating the growth of the Tree of Qliphot.  In a smaller inset panel, another character, seemingly blind, contemplates the exchange of his blindness for these abilities.  A previous panel shows a fight scene with multiple characters, possibly in a different location, with the text implying the actions of the eccentric characters are connected to the events in the library. The overall color scheme is dark blue and purple.
