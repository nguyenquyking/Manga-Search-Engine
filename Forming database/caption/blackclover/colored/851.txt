A Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A grotesque, grinning character (likely a demon or antagonist) boasts about his power, stating he's superior and that another character ("you") cannot bring him joy.  The other character, possibly Asta, looks distressed and responds that he's just a peasant.  A smaller panel shows a younger Asta, now an elf, with narration explaining his incredible instincts and increasing strength through reincarnation.  Another panel depicts magical elements/attributes, suggesting a magic battle is taking place or imminent.
