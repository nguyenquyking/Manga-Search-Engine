A colored manga panel depicts a dramatic confrontation.  A character resembling Asta (from Black Clover), glowing bright green, wields a large, glowing green staff, attacking a shadowy, skeletal figure.  Asta's attack creates a powerful energy blast.  In smaller panels, Asta's face shows determination, and text indicates his opponent's regenerative abilities are increasing.  The overall scene is action-packed and highlights a powerful clash.
