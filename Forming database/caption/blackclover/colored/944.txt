Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a large, pale woman with flowing white hair, seemingly made of water, rescues two characters from a swirling vortex of water.  The woman, possibly a water elemental or magical being, expresses gratitude for their rescue of Lolopechka.  In a separate panel, Asta, a Black Clover character with spiky black hair, expresses his distress and helplessness, stating he's "completely useless."  The overall color scheme is predominantly blue, reflecting the water theme.
