Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, a young magic knight, looking shocked and confused.  Asta is being accused of using demonic power.  Another character, possibly a member of the Magic Parliament, explains that commoners like Asta are being used as scapegoats by the Magic Knights.  The scene shows a trial is to be held to judge users of demonic power.  The panel also shows a flashback to a past event where elves took over people's bodies.  The overall tone is one of tension and injustice.
