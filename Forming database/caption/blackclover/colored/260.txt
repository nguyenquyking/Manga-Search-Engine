Black Clover manga scene depicting a conversation between a muscular man with dark hair and a woman with long blonde hair.  The man, seemingly surprised, inquires about a curse she had.  The woman explains the curse was different; it was the work of a curse magic user holding a grudge against her family.  The curse, involving forbidden magic interfering with the nature of life, was supposed to activate when she turned 18.  A dark, winged figure is shown, possibly representing the curse.  Visual elements include a table with drinks, a book, and thorny vines with blue roses.
