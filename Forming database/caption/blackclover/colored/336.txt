Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation between a group of magic knights and a powerful demon, Loro-Pechika.  A female knight, possibly Loro-Pechika, is shown bleeding from the nose, while another knight expresses concern. The scene highlights the power disparity between the knights and the demon, with dialogue emphasizing the difficulty of defeating demons and the need for superior power.  A larger, powerful, blue-haired demon is present, dominating the background. The panel also shows a smaller image of the Spirit Guardians using powerful magic, borrowing from natural mana.  The art style is consistent with Black Clover.
