Black Clover manga scene depicting a large-scale battle.  A character, possibly Yuno, engages in combat within a massive, light-colored, cracked structure, emanating energy beams. Another character, possibly a dark-haired elf, is also present near the center of the destruction.  In the background, a cloaked figure watches.  The bottom panel shows a wide shot of widespread destruction, likely caused by the sword's power, with multiple beams striking the ground.  Two additional characters, one with grey hair (likely a prominent antagonist) and one with dark hair, observe the scene, commenting on the sword's power and the elves being drawn out. The visual style is dynamic, with strong action lines emphasizing the power of the attack.
