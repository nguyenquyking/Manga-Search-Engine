A manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A demonic, pale-skinned creature with long white hair and pointed ears, possibly a devil or similar entity, has its hand severed. Blood is visible.  Another character, seemingly human, is shown reacting with a surprised expression ("Hey..."). The severed limb is shown in the lower right panel, alongside the creatureâ€™s shocked reaction ("What's this?"). Text bubbles indicate surprise and disbelief at the severed limb.  The style suggests a dark fantasy or action setting.
