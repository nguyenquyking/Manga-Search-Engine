Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows Finral and Mimosa discussing an infiltration. The second shows Black Bulls members, including Asta, Yuno, and others, voraciously eating a large quantity of food.  Zora's absence is noted, along with Gauche and Grey being ill. Gordon is learning hex magic.  The final panel focuses on a character (likely Asta) contemplating a visit to Golden Dawn headquarters.  The overall theme is a mission briefing followed by a frantic food-eating scene, and a plan of action.
