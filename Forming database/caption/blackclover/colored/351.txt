A colorized manga panel depicts a scene unfolding in three parts.  The first panel shows a woman with round, swirling glasses, expressing surprise and commenting on a character's tenacity and dislike of losing. The second panel showcases a large, powerful energy wave or attack streaking across a landscape, implying a significant event has just occurred.  The third panel shows a group of people, possibly soldiers or civilians,  being directed by a commanding figure towards a building, with instructions to take the fallen inside. In the background, a bright explosion suggests the conclusion of a battle.  No specific character names are identified in the panels.
