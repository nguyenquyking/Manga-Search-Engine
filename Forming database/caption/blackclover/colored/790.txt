One Piece manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A severely wounded woman with long red hair is shown in the bottom panel,  blood dripping from her mouth.  Above her, two monstrous entities, seemingly demonic, are shown engaging in dialogue.  The text bubbles indicate they are contemplating killing someone ("We'll kill him," "Let's kill him").  The overall scene is violent and dramatic, suggesting a climactic confrontation between the woman and the powerful demons.  The text "THERE IS NO HUMAN..." and "...WHO COULD BEAT A SUPREME DEVIL" emphasizes the overwhelming power of the demonic beings.
