Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image panels:  Multiple panels depict a magical power surge.  Panel one shows a surprised character (light-colored hair and clothing) amidst a bright, fiery energy, observed by a red-haired character in dark robes who expresses disbelief.  Panel two shows a dark-haired girl, seemingly delighted, unleashing green magical energy, which encompasses a smaller, light-colored figure. A wolf-like creature observes this. Panel three shows a bright magical energy emanating from two individuals (one with light hair) on the ground, observed by another character (dark hair).  A character with short hair witnesses the event and comments on the light's intensity.  The overall scene suggests a magical battle or power display.
