Black Clover manga scene depicting a tense meeting.  Several characters are present:  a figure with long dark hair seated at a table (possibly Asta or Yami Sukehiro), two individuals with white hair (likely Noelle Silva and a second character, potentially a captain),  a person with reddish-brown hair and a red mark on their forehead (possibly Fuegoleon), and another figure in green (potentially a captain).  The scene suggests a conflict or disagreement, indicated by the speech bubbles and characters' expressions and body language.  The setting appears to be a formal room or council chamber.  A large, stylized action line suggests a powerful event or interruption.
