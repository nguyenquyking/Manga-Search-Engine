Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  Asta, from Black Clover, points and asks a small, horned devil-like creature its name.  Another scene shows Asta in a room with a blonde-haired individual, who also asks for Asta's name, and states they don't have one. Asta offers to give the individual a name.  In the final panel, Asta smiles, seemingly pleased, while a light-haired woman, Liebe, smiles and introduces herself to Asta. The panels showcase dialogue bubbles, highlighting the characters' interactions and the focus on naming conventions.
