Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows Gauche Adlai relieved and holding a seemingly unconscious person (likely his sister, Marie). The second shows Gauche and Marie on the ground, Gauche appearing shaken.  The third shows Yami Sukehiro, Asta, and a worried-looking woman (likely Noelle Silva), reacting to a situation. The fourth shows Asta, and Yami, along with other figures in the background; a defeated enemy lies on the ground.  Asta is speaking to Yami, expressing frustration.  The overall scene depicts the aftermath of a battle, with a focus on the characters' emotional reactions and the capture of a major enemy.
