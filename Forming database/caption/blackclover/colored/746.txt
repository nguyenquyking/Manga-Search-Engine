Black Clover manga panel depicting several high-ranking devils, including a large central devil with multiple eyes and horns, and smaller, grotesque devils.  The central devil is described as enjoying a "game of catch" using mana.  A smaller panel shows Asta, using his magic, against numerous other, lower-ranking devils.  A female elf-like character is also shown in a separate panel, discussing the challenges of fighting different levels of devils. The text indicates the higher-level devils are more powerful and difficult to defeat.
