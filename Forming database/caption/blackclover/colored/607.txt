Black Clover manga scene: Asta, in a furious expression, confronts a shadowy figure, possibly Licht,  within a skull-adorned chamber.  Asta's anti-magic clashes with the dark magic emanating from the shadowy figure, who declares, "If it's not going to work anyway..."  Another character, possibly Liebe, is shown alongside Asta, also displaying a fierce expression.  The scene is filled with dark energy and chains, suggesting a perilous battle.  The background features a dark, ominous architecture with numerous skulls.
