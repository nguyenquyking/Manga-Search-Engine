Black Clover manga scene depicting a battle.  A horned, dark-cloaked figure (likely a powerful antagonist) boasts about his invincibility, stating no spell can defeat him.  A green-cloaked magic user (likely Asta or a similar character) is shown concentrating, working on a counter-attack. Another character with reddish-brown hair, possibly a comrade, expresses concern about the opponent's overwhelming mana.  A third character, with dark hair, reflects on the strength of their unit.  The scene is dynamic, filled with energy effects representing magic attacks and power. The visual style is typical of Black Clover's dramatic fight sequences.
