Black Clover manga colorized panel depicting two powerful magic knights.  A red-haired knight with a red cape and a white-haired knight in a blue robe stand prominently, a fiery dragon-like creature partially visible behind them.  Text bubbles indicate recognition of their capabilities regardless of social class and concern over the potential loss of such valuable squad members. A second panel shows a serious-looking man, possibly a captain, pondering a strategy, while another panel reveals a shocked woman, seemingly addressing Captain Fuegoleon, an elder brother, in an assembly of royal captains.
