A Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle between Asta and Noelle.  The top panels show a large, light blue dragon-like creature engulfing someone, with blood splatter visible. Asta, with red demonic energy and a ferocious expression, is shown in the lower panels, seemingly striking Noelle with a sword. Noelle, in her Valkyrie armor, is shown reacting to Asta's attack, with a speech bubble stating "You're fantastic, Noeeeeelle!!!!"  Impact and motion lines enhance the dynamic action.  Blood is prominently featured throughout the scene.
