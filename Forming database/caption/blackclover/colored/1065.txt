Asta, severely injured and lying on the ground, is shown in a multi-panel manga-style image.  A powerful, demonic entity looms over him, its hand reaching down.  Text bubbles indicate the demon is calling Asta a "filthy brat" and declaring that he is the cause of the destruction visible in a background panel. The demon is saying "Die!" Another panel shows the aftermath of an attack, possibly depicting Asta's near-death state. The overall scene depicts a confrontation between Asta and a powerful antagonist.
