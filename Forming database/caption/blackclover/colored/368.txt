A colorized manga panel depicts a battle scene. A masked figure, possibly a mage, unleashes a purple "Basilisk's Breath" attack, engulfing the area in poisonous fumes.  The mage, wielding potent "Ingenious Poison Creation Magic," declares the opponent no match for his abilities.  The opponent, unseen but implied to be significantly weakened, is shown in a lower panel, their eye conveying defeat and the uselessness of their fortress without sufficient resources.  The text indicates a power differential, with the mage initially underestimating the opponent's strength.
