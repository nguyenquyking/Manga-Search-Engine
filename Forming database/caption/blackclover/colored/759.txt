A dynamic One Piece manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  A character, possibly a powerful enemy, wielding dark, spiky magic attacks a smaller figure.  The larger figure is cloaked in dark, shadowy energy, while the smaller figure is engulfed in fiery, orange magic.  The smaller figure states their attacks are ineffective against the opponent's seemingly limitless magic.  The scene is filled with motion lines and onomatopoeia (e.g., "KRAKL," "FOOM," "ZZT") emphasizing the intensity of the conflict.  Text bubbles reveal internal monologue and dialogue, highlighting the smaller figure's desperate situation and the overwhelming power of their opponent.
