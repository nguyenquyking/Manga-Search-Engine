A manga panel depicts a serious courtroom scene.  A judge-like figure holds a scale of justice, labeled "DAMNATIO," while addressing a young, blond-haired individual. The judge states his intention to take responsibility for everything, even his state.  The blond individual, possibly a member of the Black Bulls, argues that this mission is a good idea as it allows those involved to redeem themselves and potentially benefit their kingdom.  The judge counters that the kingdom cannot bear the responsibility alone. The overall tone is serious and emphasizes a conflict between individual responsibility and the burden on the kingdom.
