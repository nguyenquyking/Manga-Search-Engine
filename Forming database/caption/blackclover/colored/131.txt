A Black Clover manga panel depicts a battle scene.  Noelle Silva, a magic knight, is shown using her magic, a vine-like spell with glowing red flowers, to attack an unseen opponent.  She is surprised by the opponent's ability, commenting on their concentration.  In a separate panel, a male character, possibly a captain, looks on, smoking a cigarette, seemingly concerned about Noelle's struggle and referencing her status as a foreign Magic Knight. The background suggests a dark, chaotic environment with many shadowy figures.
