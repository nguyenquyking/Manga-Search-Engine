Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and Liebe. Asta, with spiky blond hair and a black headband, extends his hand towards Liebe, a demonic figure with white hair, red eyes, and horns.  Asta's speech bubble reads, "Let's crush the bad guys together!!"  A katana lies between them.  Liebe's speech bubble in a subsequent panel says, "You really are a total idiot."  The image highlights a partnership between Asta and Liebe, despite Liebe's sarcastic remark.
