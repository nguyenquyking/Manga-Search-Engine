A colored manga panel depicting a scene from Black Clover.  The top panel shows a large, complex magical circle, possibly a Qliphoth ritual site.  The next panel shows Dante, with red eyes and dark markings, smirking; text indicates "Dante Lost".  The following panels show a character's hand offering cookies (recovery magic sweets) to a group.  This group includes Asta, Yuno, and other Black Bulls members.  The text discusses the difficulty of defeating the remaining Dark Triad members and the effect on Qliphoth's efficiency. The overall scene suggests a post-battle situation with the Black Bulls assessing the damage and strategizing.
