One Piece manga color spread depicting multiple scenes and characters.  Asta, seemingly distressed, is shown in the top left panel, expressing the need to get stronger.  The panel to the right shows a flashback, mentioning allies â€“ the First Magic Emperor and the Elf Leader.  The next row shows a conversation between a scarred man (possibly Gaja) and a woman with purple hair, referencing a powerful opponent. Another panel shows Gaja's scar, linked to a demon. The bottom row features a character with glowing blue hair discussing the Diamond Kingdom's situation, while another panel shows Asta reacting to information about a powerful spirit guardian encountered in the past.  The overall theme is the need for increased strength amongst the Magic Knights.
