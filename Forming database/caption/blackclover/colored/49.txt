A powerful, light-based attack pierces a monstrous, multi-limbed creature.  The creature, seemingly demonic, is pale with reddish markings and displays distress as the light engulfs it.  In a separate panel, a blond-haired individual, likely a knight or magic user, watches with a mixture of fear and determination, tears in their eyes. The word "LIGHT!" is emphasized in a speech bubble next to the blond character, indicating the nature of the attack. The background suggests a sunrise or sunset, emphasizing the dramatic contrast between the light and dark forces.  The artwork style indicates a manga or anime source.
