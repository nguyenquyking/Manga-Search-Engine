Two figures, seemingly identical in form but distinct in color, are depicted. One is enveloped in blue, icy flames, labeled "Devil Ice Magic," and the other in orange, fiery flames, labeled "Devil Flame Magic."  Both figures freeze and burn "everything," including "invisible concepts," "shadow," and "light." The visual contrast between the ice and fire is striking, highlighting their opposing magical powers.
