Black Clover manga color spread depicting a dramatic scene.  Lady Vanica is shown distressed, with sweat and speech bubbles indicating fear ("Please wai...", "No...").  Another character (likely an antagonist) is also shown in distress, sweat visible, accompanied by the text "Lady Vanica!".  A male character, possibly Asta, with spiky dark hair and golden jewelry confronts a large, purple-robed figure who is reacting with pain ("Aaa-aah!!!", "Agh..."). This figure appears to be unleashing a powerful magical attack, as indicated by the swirling purple energy and the text "THIS WHOLE AREA'S GOING TO BLOW SKY-HIGH...".  Another panel shows Noelle receiving encouragement, implying the impending danger.  The overall tone suggests a high-stakes magical battle.
