Asta, severely injured and bleeding, is shown in a dynamic action sequence.  He is engaged in intense combat, possibly against a powerful demonic entity with red eyes and horns (likely a possessed individual or a demon) whose attack is depicted as a fast-moving, destructive force.  Another character, possibly an ally, is shown with a concerned expression, warning Asta that if he continues fighting at this pace, he'll be killed. The scene is filled with motion lines suggesting high speed and impactful blows. The background includes a multitude of skulls, adding to the grim intensity of the battle.
