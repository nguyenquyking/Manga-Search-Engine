Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  A blond noble reveals a near-empty grimoire, lamenting the loss of most of their magic.  Another scene shows a conversation between the blond noble and a man smoking, with the blond seemingly amused. Asta, significantly smaller than usual, is shown in shock.  A final panel shows the blond noble and a dark-haired woman observing a large, circular stone object labeled "Swallowtail," described as an ancient magic storage device.  The overall narrative focuses on the aftermath of a battle, the weakened influence of nobles, and the discovery of an ancient magical artifact.
