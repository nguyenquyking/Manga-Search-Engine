Black Clover manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A powerful, shadowy figure with glowing red eyes, seemingly possessing a grimoire, confronts Licht, who is  injured but fighting back, using a trident-like weapon.  Other characters, including a female character with short pink hair and a male character with green eyes, observe the fight.  Licht declares his invincibility due to his physical form and grimoire. The shadowy figure is overpowering, and text suggests even combined efforts cannot stop him.  The scene is filled with dark red energy effects, suggesting intense magical combat.
