A Black Clover manga panel depicts Asta crying, blaming himself for being weak ("It's your fault for being weak!!!").  He's shown in close-up, visibly distressed with tears streaming down his face.  A smaller panel shows a young Asta on the ground, looking distraught while an unseen figure calls him a fool ("You're a fool.").  The overall mood is one of intense self-reproach and despair.  Asta is the only clearly identifiable character.
