Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where several characters, including Gauche Adlai, are observing a phenomenon. Gauche appears worried, and her hands are clasped together.  An older man with glasses observes a man whose body has been seemingly reassembled, with the implication that he was run through with a giant sword.  The scene highlights the extraordinary regenerative abilities displayed, described as "beyond recovery". The overall tone suggests wonder and concern regarding the nature of the magic involved.
