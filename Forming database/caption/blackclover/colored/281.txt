A colorized One Piece manga panel depicting a gruesome scene inside a workshop of curses.  A table is covered in blood and what appears to be body parts.  Various jars, tools, and occult objects are scattered around the room, indicating a dark and sinister atmosphere.  Three characters are shown in smaller panels: a horrified woman with teal hair reacting with shock; a man in a military-style cap looking grim, commenting on the "wicked research"; and a person with dark clothing and mask, describing the workshop as "beautiful". The overall image conveys horror and disgust.
