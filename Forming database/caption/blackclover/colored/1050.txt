One Piece manga panel depicting a fiery battle.  A character, possibly a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user, in a dragon form is shown in the upper panel, flying through a fiery explosion.  A second panel shows a close-up of a  character, possibly the same one, engulfed in flames, roaring "Rraaaah!!" and attacking the dragon's neck.  The final panel shows a close-up of another character's face, seemingly unaffected, stating "Pointless."  The scene is intensely fiery, with orange and yellow hues dominating the visuals. The overall mood is one of intense combat.
