Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a bloodied, heavily injured Licht.  Licht screams in pain ("AH!", "AAR-GH!", "AH!") while Asta, smiling menacingly, declares he made a vow with Licht ("I MADE... A VOW WITH HIM...").  Licht is shown in various states of distress and physical damage.  Asta's statement is juxtaposed with smaller panels showing Licht's own strength and Asta stating, "I am you."  The background suggests a library setting.  The overall scene portrays a powerful confrontation and the complex relationship between Asta and Licht.
