A colored manga panel depicting a scene from Black Clover.  A grinning man with green eyes and markings on his forehead anticipates a fight.  He's positioned beside a large, green, cylindrical containment unit holding a naked, pale-skinned man with dark hair and chest wounds.  The contained man appears unconscious or drugged.  The panel also shows a second, smaller, similar containment unit with a person inside, seemingly a scientist or researcher.  A third character, possibly an associate of the first, observes the scene, wearing a fur-trimmed coat. The overall mood is one of anticipation and possibly sinister experimentation.
