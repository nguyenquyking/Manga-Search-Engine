Asta, from Black Clover, unleashes a powerful, dark-red energy surge, possibly a Devil Union form.  The energy is depicted with intense, dynamic lines and dark pink/red coloring.  Below, a monstrous, ancient demon with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth is shown, seemingly the source or target of Asta's attack.  A third panel features a concerned blond-haired character (likely a supporting character, potentially Yuno or another Black Bull member) observing the confrontation, with text explaining the demon's immense magical power and Asta's destructive fighting style. The overall scene depicts a high-stakes battle with significant magical energy.
