A Black Clover manga panel depicts a scene where a character, seemingly using Briar Magic, unleashes a large thorny vine with red roses. The vine attacks multiple opponents who are shown reacting with expressions of pain and surprise.  One character, whose face is prominently displayed, is clearly using Briar Magic, as the text "True Briar Magic" indicates.  The text within the panels states that the vine is the user's "rightful Red Rose."  The scene is set within what appears to be an arena or battleground.
