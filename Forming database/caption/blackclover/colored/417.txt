Black Clover manga page 256: A character, possibly a demon or devil-possessed individual, wearing a crown and dark attire with glowing blue markings, is shown wielding a large, glowing purple grimoire.  The character's expression is serious, and text bubbles indicate fear ("He'll kill me...") and the character's immense power ("Devil power... Instantly!!! ...at 80 percent").  The background is dark blue, with shadowy wings suggesting immense power or a demonic presence.  The overall scene conveys impending danger and a powerful magical confrontation.
