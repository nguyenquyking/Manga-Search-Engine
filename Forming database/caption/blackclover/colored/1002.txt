A colored manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  A character, possibly Allen, is fighting a demonic figure engulfed in orange flames. The demon has horns and glowing red eyes. Allen is wielding a dark, swirling energy, possibly a type of magic. Text boxes indicate Allen's intention to kill the demon, even at the risk of widespread destruction.  Smaller panels show the potential consequences: a town and kingdom threatened by the ensuing chaos, and concerned faces of other characters observing the scene.  The overall mood is tense and dramatic.
