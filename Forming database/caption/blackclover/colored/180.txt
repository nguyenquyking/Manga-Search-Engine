A colored manga panel shows a conversation between two characters, Yami Sukehiro and a blonde character (likely Yami's subordinate). Yami, looking somber, is told he was "totally dead" and that his return is surprising.  The blonde character expresses fear and comments on Yami's social standing possibly contributing to his miraculous return. Yami, turning away, states he paid his respects already, implying a previous encounter with death. The scene suggests a reunion after a significant event involving Yami's near-death experience.  The background includes a smaller panel depicting a past moment involving Yami and possibly the blonde character.
