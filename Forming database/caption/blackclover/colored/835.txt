A manga panel depicting a powerful character, possibly a Devil or dark magic user, wielding fiery, golden chains. The main character is centrally positioned, radiating dark energy, with a large, sun-like orb emanating from their chest.  They wear a dark, horned mask and robe.  The chains extend outward, ensnaring a smaller, less powerful character in the lower panel who reacts with surprise and fear. The smaller character is shown being attacked by the fiery chains.  The overall scene conveys a sense of intense power and conflict.  The text indicates surprise and the nature of the weapon used:  "A Chain?".
