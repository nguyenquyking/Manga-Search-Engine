A colored manga panel depicts Asta, sweating profusely and straining, running forcefully to the right.  His expression is one of exertion and determination.  To his left, another character, partially visible, is frozen in place, their face showing shock and inability to move. Text bubbles indicate the latter character's inability to move and the questioning of Asta's actions by an unseen character whose boots are visible at the bottom of the panel.  Speed lines and sweat droplets emphasize the intensity of Asta's movement. The color palette is dark, highlighting the dramatic tension of the scene.
