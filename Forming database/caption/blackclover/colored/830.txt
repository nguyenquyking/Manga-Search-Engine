A manga panel depicting a confrontation.  Three dark-cloaked figures with dark magic are facing a powerful opponent.  The opponent, seemingly confident, declares their superior magic power, stating their magic is far too low, and that even a combined attack would be pointless.  The scene shifts to a close-up of the confident opponent, who smirks and declares they will take down the other characters alone.  The overall tone is one of intense conflict and overwhelming power imbalance.
