One Piece manga panel depicting a scene titled "Blue Rose Paradise," showcasing a modified Briar Magic technique called "Mana Method."  A powerful dark magic user, possibly a villain, sits on a throne amidst a field of blooming blue roses.  The roses are imbued with the curse of their victims, growing larger and more vibrant as the curse intensifies.  Two large, dark-skinned men are entangled and weakened by the thorns of the blue roses. A smaller, light-skinned, blonde-haired character observes, seemingly pleased with the results of their spell.  The narrative text explains that the stronger the enemy's curse, the more powerful the roses become, suggesting a parasitic relationship between the curse and the magic.
