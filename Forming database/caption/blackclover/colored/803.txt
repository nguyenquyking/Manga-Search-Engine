Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A colored manga panel depicts a dramatic confrontation.  In the top panel, a shadowy figure with a dark, red-tinged weapon engages with two figures, one with white hair and large blue wings, and another with white hair seated on a crystalline structure. Below, close-ups show a demonic-looking figure, possibly Naamah, speaking, with speech bubbles indicating commentary on a prior event. Another panel shows Asta, with his distinctive anti-magic grimoire. The overall scene is intense and suggests a powerful battle.
