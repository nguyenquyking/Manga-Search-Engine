A powerful, dark, monstrous creature attacks, dwarfing the Color Clover mages.  A high-ranking mage, possibly a leader, with light green hair and a large mustache, uses "Vortex Magic: Area Helix" to attempt to counter the creature.  The attack creates a swirling, light blue vortex.  Other Color Clover members are shown fleeing or reacting with fear. One woman exclaims that the creature is too large to handle.  The scene is chaotic and emphasizes the overwhelming size and power of the monster.
