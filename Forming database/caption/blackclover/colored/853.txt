Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga panel:  A close-up panel depicts a tense interaction between three characters.  A fierce, intensely expressive character with purple-tinged hair and a scarred face declares, "...will never, ever lose..." He's contrasted with a calmer, dark-haired man smoking a cigarette who observes, "...because you looked like the gutsiest one out there."  A third character, a man with short, spiky purple hair and glasses, looks on silently. The scene's overall tone is one of confrontation and assessment of courage.
