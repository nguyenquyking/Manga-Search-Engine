One Piece manga panel depicting a large, fiery, celestial event.  A shadowy figure, possibly a villain, speaks, threatening to kill everyone unless their demands are met.  In the background, a town is shown under a large, ominous, red and orange orb in the sky.  Multiple smaller panels show a group of people, seemingly prisoners or hostages, looking up in fear at the celestial event. The main panel focuses on the impending destruction and the villain's power. The dialogue boxes indicate a threatening situation.
