Black Clover manga scene depicting a confrontation.  A young prince, Asta, is shocked by a powerful evil mana, realizing it's not from the Minister. The Minister, appearing calm, addresses the prince. Another panel shows a figure seemingly vanquished in a pool of blood.  A shadowy figure, possibly embodying despair or hatred, reveals themselves, unfazed by their identity.  Asta's confusion and the shadowy figure's indifference are central to the scene.
