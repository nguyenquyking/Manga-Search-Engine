Black Clover manga panel depicting a chaotic battle scene.  Yami Sukehiro, looking grim, observes a devastating magical attack.  A blonde female elf character expresses alarm at the demon's power.  Another scene shows a young mage, likely a royal, determined to protect the Clover Kingdom, while a powerful elf-like individual pledges temporary support.
