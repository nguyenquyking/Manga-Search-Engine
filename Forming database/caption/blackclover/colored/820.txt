A colored manga panel depicts a fierce confrontation.  A Supreme Devil, characterized by dark purple, tentacle-like appendages and glowing red eyes, is engaged in battle.  The Devil is threatening to grind its opponent into pulp and kill every human.  A character with dark hair and red eyes, seemingly defying the Devil, vows to hold it for at least a moment.  The scene is filled with intense magical energy, visually represented by swirling purple and orange hues, and shards of ice. The overall tone is one of high stakes and impending doom.
