A colored manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  Two figures, one pale and seemingly ethereal with long hair, and another with dark hair and red eyes, face off. The pale figure speaks of playing together, while the dark-haired figure, possibly injured and bleeding, reacts with shock ("What...in...?!!").  Sharp ice shards are visible throughout the scene, suggesting a power struggle involving ice magic. The dark-haired character appears distressed and possibly attacked.  The overall scene is intense and suggests a significant moment of conflict or revelation.
