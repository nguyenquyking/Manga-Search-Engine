A colorized manga panel depicts a character, seemingly wielding water creation magic.  The character, with white hair and light blue clothing, possesses large, dark purple wings, and is actively summoning a large, serpentine wave of water labeled "Water Creation Magic: Sea Serpent's Bellow." The attack is directed towards a city in the background, shown to be under assault by the water magic.  Dynamic action lines and onomatopoeia ("SPLOOSH," "BOOM," "KERSPLASH") emphasize the force and impact of the attack.
