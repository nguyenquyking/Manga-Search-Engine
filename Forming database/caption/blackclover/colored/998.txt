Two young men, rivals, stand in a snowy village overlooking a castle.  One has dark hair, the other light gray. They discuss becoming Commander in Chief.  A subsequent panel shows the light-haired boy using magic, while the dark-haired boy expresses his unwillingness to become a Devil Host. The dark-haired boy then apologizes to his older brother. The scene is set in a wintry, medieval-style town.
