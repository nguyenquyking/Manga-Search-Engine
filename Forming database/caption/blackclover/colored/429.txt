A manga panel depicting a powerful confrontation. A colossal, demonic figure, seemingly possessing dark magic, dominates the scene.  This entity, with glowing blue runes on its chest and holding a large, dark book, is shown in a powerful pose, implying significant magical ability.  Text indicates it is "not human anymore."  Opposite this figure is a bloodied, but resolute, human character who appears to be in shock or awe.  Smaller panels show additional characters, possibly allies, reacting with shock and concern. The overall color scheme is dark, with contrasting blue energy effects highlighting the demonic figure's power.  The text suggests the demonic figure's regeneration abilities are fueled by a devil's power.
