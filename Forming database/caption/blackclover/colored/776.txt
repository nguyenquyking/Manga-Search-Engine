A colored manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A distraught individual, possibly a woman, pleads, "Save my brother!!! I'm begging you!!!" while another character, appearing calm and possibly male, states, "I really loved you."  The first character is shown in close-up, visibly distressed, with text indicating a difficult decision ("Who should die?") and defending the innocence of someone ("He hasn't done anything wrong!!!"). The second character's statement contrasts with the chaotic energy surrounding the first. The scene also includes a smaller panel showing two figures, possibly a woman comforting a younger person, suggesting a related story element. The overall mood is intense, highlighting a conflict involving brotherly love and sacrifice.
