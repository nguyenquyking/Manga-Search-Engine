A colored manga panel depicts a scene where Yami is captured and restrained by numerous dark, shadowy, clawed arms emanating from a dark background.  A cloaked figure holds a glowing blue book. Another panel shows a distressed character, possibly Asta, sweating and expressing worry about Yami's rescue, while a dark, shadowy figure with a visible yellow eye declares that a human cannot defeat them.  The overall scene suggests a tense and dangerous situation.
