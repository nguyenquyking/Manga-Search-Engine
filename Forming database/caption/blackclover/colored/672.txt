Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation.  A female character, possibly Charlotte, in a dark, ornate red and black robe with a crown, laughs maniacally ("AH HA HA HA HA HA HA!").  She is seated and appears powerful.  Another character, possibly Yami, is seen from behind in the top panel, and a close-up of a menacing eye and mouth is shown in the lower right. A third character, possibly a young boy, expresses shock. Text boxes reveal dialogue concerning Charlotte's strength and a declaration to "save" someone. The overall scene suggests a battle or impending conflict.
