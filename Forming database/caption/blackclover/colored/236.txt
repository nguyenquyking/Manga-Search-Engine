A manga panel depicting a courtroom scene and related conversations.  Several characters are present, including Julius, a powerful figure who uses his royal privilege to influence public opinion.  A "demon culprit" has been dealt with by magic knights, averting a crisis.  However, this is portrayed as a postponement of a sentence, effectively shifting blame onto the magic knights by exiling a "possessed child."  The scene involves discussions about political maneuvering and the manipulation of public perception.  The visual style is consistent with manga artwork.
