Black Clover manga scene:  A battle between a horned, crown-wearing character (likely a demon or powerful magic user) and another character with dark hair. The horned character is emitting dark purple magic, inflicting damage shown by red slashes.  The second character is reacting to the attack. A separate panel shows a third character (likely an ally) observing, commenting on the impressive, albeit disliked, magic being used.  The overall scene depicts intense combat with magical abilities.
