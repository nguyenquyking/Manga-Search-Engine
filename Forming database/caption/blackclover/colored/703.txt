One Piece manga panel depicting a horde of demonic, winged creatures with sharp teeth and claws attacking a snowy city.  The creatures are red and pink, exhibiting various grotesque features.  In smaller panels, other characters react in horror and fear; one character with orange hair remarks that the magic feels like that from "back then," suggesting a previous encounter.  The overall scene is chaotic and intense, with a focus on the scale and ferocity of the demonic attack.
