Black Clover manga color spread depicting multiple scenes.  The top panel shows a woman reacting with shock ("It's Asta!"), observing Asta protecting children (including a young girl) from nuns.  The next panel shows the same children, now with a priest, and the implication that Asta is protecting the kingdom.  The bottom panels show two characters reacting to the situation: one, possibly a noble, comments on the unexpected beauty of the situation, while another expresses frustration ("Protected by that peasant!!").  Asta is not directly shown in the lower panels but is the clear subject of the scene.  The overall tone is one of surprise and conflicting reactions to Asta's actions.
