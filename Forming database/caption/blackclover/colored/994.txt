Manga comic panel depicting a scene with several characters.  A young man with dark hair and facial injuries is the focus of concern, with another character asking "Did you get hurt again?".  A woman reacts with "Wow, looser." while another man observes, commenting on the injured man's "pathetic" state in comparison to his capabilities.  A subsequent panel shows the injured man, identified as having "greater aptitude for being a devil host than Dante or Vanica," suggesting a supernatural context. A further panel shows two other characters, one seemingly comforting the other who is in a wheelchair. The overall setting is a snowy town with a large castle in the background.  The panels suggest a familial interaction tinged with rivalry and supernatural abilities.
