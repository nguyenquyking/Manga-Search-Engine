A color manga panel depicts a character, seemingly male, with short, light-blue hair and purple eyes, grinning despite visible bloody wounds on his face and arms.  He's wearing a dark jacket with gold buttons.  Surrounding him are numerous ethereal, winged figures, seemingly glowing light-blue, reminiscent of angels. These figures are in flight, suggesting a magical ability. Text bubbles indicate the activation of "Twilight Valhalla," a power that grants invincibility for a short period, boosting the magic of companions within its range. The character is ecstatic about this temporary invincibility, acknowledging that the damage will return later but expressing indifference. The overall scene is dynamic and filled with energy, focusing on the character's empowered state and the magical beings surrounding him.
