Black Clover manga panel depicting a confrontation between two characters.  The top panel shows a close-up of Asta, with bright orange hair, and his opponent, whose name is not visible, but has bright green hair. Asta is identified as the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn.  Both characters are visibly injured. The lower panel shows a powerful, dark, demonic-looking entity attacking someone who appears to be small in comparison, engulfed in a purple sphere of energy.  The text indicates a power imbalance and the futility of emotions and tenacity against overwhelming power.
