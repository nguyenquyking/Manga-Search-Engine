Black Clover manga panel depicting Princess Lolopechka of the Heart Kingdom, Asta, and other characters. Lolopechka, serene and calm, is shown initially reading a book.  A large, glowing blue display shows numerous scenes of the Heart Kingdom, seemingly connected to Lolopechka's power over water. Asta and another character (possibly a subordinate) observe this display.  A panel shows Lolopechka's ability to manipulate water, with text explaining her inherited power and immense processing capabilities. Another character expresses concern about Lolopechka's speed and observes the growth of plants, indicating the positive effects of her powers.  The overall tone is one of peace and showcasing Lolopechka's abilities and benevolent influence on the Heart Kingdom.
