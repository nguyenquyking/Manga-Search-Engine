Another character, a light-skinned man with silver hair and glasses wearing a light gray, diamond-adorned coat, stands to the right, expressing surprise with the words "Isn't that..." indicating recognition of Morris and the magical array. The overall scene suggests a moment of revelation or confrontation related to Morris's exile and magical abilities.
