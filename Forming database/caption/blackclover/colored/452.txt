Asta is shown mid-attack,  apparently using magic,  against a large, dark, horned figure with glowing white markings.  The demonic entity is stated to be crushing everything.  Asta declares "â€¦will win!". The lower panel shows the dwindling time limit for Asta's devil power, indicated by a fleshy, tentacled form receding.
