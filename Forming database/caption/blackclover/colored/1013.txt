Black Clover manga panel depicting Langris Vaude and a younger brother inside a purple magical barrier. Langris is reacting with a surprised and slightly concerned expression, saying "Hiya, Langris!!". His brother appears distressed, mouth agape, and says "...Brother?!".  Another character, partially visible, seems to be attacking the barrier.  The overall scene is filled with dynamic action lines and purple magical effects. A book lies on the ground near Langris's feet. The image is colorized with a purple filter.
