A Black Clover manga panel depicts a confrontation between two characters.  One, seemingly Asta, is surrounded by a large, swirling, purple spatial magic energy burst. The other character, with dark hair and facial markings, observes Asta, stating that he understands Asta's presence and that they hoped Asta would cancel out his spatial magic.  A lower panel shows a bird's-eye view of a red-carpeted hallway within a large, three-dimensional structure, seemingly manipulated by spatial magic, labeled "Spatial Mana Domination".  The overall scene portrays a powerful spatial magic confrontation.
