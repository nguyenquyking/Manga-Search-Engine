Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a character, possibly Nacht, is observing a situation.  He notes that his preparations for descent are complete, and three powerful mages of the same gender are present.  Another character, seemingly female with blonde hair and a flower crown, is shown reacting with shock and bleeding, overwhelmed by a curse's power.  The scene also shows red and blue roses blooming and then disintegrating. Lucifer and others remain unaware.
