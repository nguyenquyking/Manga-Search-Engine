Two demonic figures, possibly sisters, with white hair and dark skin, are shown.  One is larger, and the other smaller. They are exhibiting menacing expressions and powerful energy, with speech bubbles indicating commands like "Break," "Torment," "Kill," and "Toy with."  The smaller figure is described as "Lucifero's toy." A third figure, seemingly malevolent, with dark clothing and horns, is shown laughing maniacally and declaring this is the world he wanted. The scene is dark and fiery, suggestive of a battle or destructive power.
