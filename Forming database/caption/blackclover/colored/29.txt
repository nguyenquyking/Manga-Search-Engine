Two Black Clover characters discuss "sealing magic."  One, with short black and red hair, expresses excitement about its potential uses. The other, with short light brown hair, is amazed by the concept.  A subsequent panel shows the brown-haired character in a workshop creating "magic tools," suggesting a method to empower individuals lacking inherent magical abilities.  The tools are intended to balance society by providing access to magic for the underprivileged.
