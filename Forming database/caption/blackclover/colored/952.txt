A severely wounded Asta, covered in blood and dirt, raises his hand in defiance.  He is shown in two panels; one close-up showing his determined expression and the other depicting him amidst a fiery, dark energy surge, possibly using his anti-magic.  He internally comments on being grateful to still be able to fight. In a separate panel, a smaller image shows Asta seemingly supported by a dark-haired woman, possibly Lolopechka, whom he refers to as "Queen Lolopechka," indicating their collaboration or her support.  The overall scene conveys a sense of desperate determination in the face of overwhelming odds.
