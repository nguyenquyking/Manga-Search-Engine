A manga panel depicting a confrontation between Asta (in his devil form) and another character. Asta, with demonic wings and glowing red eyes, is described as a "total scum-bag."  The other character, whose name is not explicitly shown, observes Asta, commenting on his difference from previous devils they've encountered.  Asta, in a close-up panel, reveals his intention to "steal your body." The overall tone is dark and intense, with a predominantly red color scheme.
