Black Clover manga scene depicting a conversation between a stern, pale-faced individual in a red-and-black military-style uniform (possibly a high-ranking officer or authority figure) and Asta, Noelle, and another character.  The uniformed individual is making a request related to a forbidden curse and demons, while Asta and Noelle look concerned.  A second panel shows the same uniformed individual speaking with a Hex Magic Knight, who explains their family's history of researching curses, poisons, and illnesses. The Hex Magic Knight is shown opening a door to reveal a dark room where other Hex Magic Knights are gathered around a table. The scene is tense and foreboding, hinting at a dangerous secret or impending conflict.
