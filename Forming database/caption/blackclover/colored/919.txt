One Piece manga panel depicting a battle.  A character with dark hair and horns (likely Vanica) is frozen mid-attack by a light blue energy blast. Another character, possibly a male with dark hair, is shown wounded and bleeding profusely, possibly indicating a previous attack. A third character (possibly a male) is shown in a separate panel explaining his actions and the consequences, seemingly related to a past event involving Vanica and another powerful being (possibly Megicula). The narrative focuses on a past battle and the speaker's decision to protect his kingdom. The overall tone is serious and dramatic.
