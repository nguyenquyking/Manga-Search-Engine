A manga panel depicting a battle scene titled "Groundswell of Su Telon" and "Sirens' Game".  On the left, multiple icy, siren-like creatures emerge from a watery explosion, impacting rocky terrain. On the right, a similar scene shows fiery creatures erupting from the ground, with a light-haired character, possibly Su Telon, wielding a paintbrush-like object, seemingly controlling the flames. Below, smaller panels show dialogue: a character discusses the dark magic user who defeated Dante; another character reflects on a battle with an anti-magic opponent; a third notes the incompatibility of Briar magic; and a final character muses on the versatility of picture magic. The overall scene showcases intense magical combat with elemental powers.
