Two characters are engaged in intense combat.  One, with dark hair and markings on his face, is shown using a glowing magic-like ability from his hand.  The other character, with purple hair, is wielding a red, skull-emblazoned book. The scene depicts a powerful energy blast, with debris flying. The purple-haired character is taunting the other, stating he will constantly regenerate while taking damage, proposing a more even fight afterward.  The dark-haired character notes their original specifications are completely different.
