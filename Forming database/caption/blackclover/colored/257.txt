Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between Yami Sukehiro, Asta, and a blonde woman (likely a character introduced in a later arc, needing further context for accurate identification).  Yami and the woman are engaged in an awkward interaction, with the woman visibly flustered and Yami seemingly oblivious. Asta observes the scene, expressing his belief that the woman does not hate Yami.  The scene is framed by text bubbles revealing internal thoughts and dialogue clarifying the characters' feelings and the overall tense situation.  The visual style utilizes dramatic close-ups of facial expressions to emphasize the emotional weight of the scene.
