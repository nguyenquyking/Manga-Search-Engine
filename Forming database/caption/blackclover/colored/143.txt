A Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta, sweating profusely,  leaning against a dark brick wall.  He is wearing his tattered dark blue and black outfit.  Next to him stands Yuno, emanating a bright green magical aura, with a glowing staff-like object.  Asta appears to be exhausted.  Above them, a close-up of a woman with dark hair and red eyes, sweat dripping from her face, expresses gratitude with a speech bubble saying "THANK YOU!!!". A glowing red book is visible on the wall behind Asta, and a glowing yellow book floats near Yuno. The scene suggests a powerful magical event has just concluded.
