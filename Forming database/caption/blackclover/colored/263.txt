Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between two female characters, one with purple hair and a pink witch-like hat adorned with roses, and the other with white hair, wearing a black and white outfit. The purple-haired character gestures and speaks, warning the other to remain silent about something Nozel did not reveal.  In the lower panels, a figure in silver clothing and a pink-robed individual are seen on a rooftop at night under a full moon, seemingly performing magic, as indicated by the stylized energy trails. The white-haired character observes this, and warns that revealing this information will result in a curse.
