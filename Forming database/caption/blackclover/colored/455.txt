Black Clover manga scene depicting a fierce battle.  A powerful, monstrous entity with a crown and tentacle-like appendages attacks Asta and other Black Bulls members.  Asta, with his anti-magic sword, confronts the creature, declaring "It's over!!!"  The creature's immense size and destructive power are emphasized by the surrounding energy effects and the text "Three Seconds."  In the upper panel, a previous moment of the battle is shown where Asta is engaged in a fast-paced attack against a section of the monster.  The scene is dynamic and showcases the intense power of both the antagonist and Asta's determination.
