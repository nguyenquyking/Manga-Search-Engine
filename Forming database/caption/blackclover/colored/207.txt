Asta, a Black Bull magic knight, vehemently argues that a demon possessed individuals, causing recent disasters.  The scene takes place in a grand courtroom, where Asta faces prejudice and skepticism from the assembled crowd and possibly judges.  A female character observes the unfolding trial, highlighting the lingering discrimination despite Emperor Julius's efforts.  The visual elements include a regal courtroom setting, Asta's distinctive appearance (spiky hair, anti-magic grimoire), and the horns mentioned as potential demon proof. The Black Bulls are implied to be under suspicion.
