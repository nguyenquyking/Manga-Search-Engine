A colored manga panel depicts a chaotic scene.  Valtos, a character with long gray hair, is shown in the top panel with another character (Nusita, with black hair and glasses), expressing frustration about their current situation.  In the central panels, a confrontation unfolds. A dark-haired character in a hooded top performs a violent act,  nearly splitting another individual in half.  The surrounding characters react with shock and anger, verbalizing their disapproval and threats.  The background suggests an urban setting with buildings visible in the bottom panel. The overall tone is one of intense conflict and violence.
