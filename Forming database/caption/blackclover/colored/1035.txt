Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  Close-up on a tense confrontation between two characters.  On the left, a horned, pale-faced figure with a skull-like mask, possibly a devil fruit user, displays a somber expression. On the right, a character with vibrant green hair, wearing a glowing crown-like structure,  exudes anger and determination.  The text "I'M THE ONE WHO'S RIGHT." is prominently displayed between them. The background depicts a chaotic battle scene with energy blasts and what appears to be a skeletal landscape.
