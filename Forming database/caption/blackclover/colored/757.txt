Two female characters, seemingly antagonists, are shown engaging in a power struggle.  One wields ice powers, manifesting as large, sharp ice shards. The other commands fire, depicted as intense orange and yellow flames.  They agree not to fight seriously, instead choosing to playfully compete using their abilities against an unseen opponent. The scene is dynamic and visually intense, filled with onomatopoeia representing the clash of powers.  The art style suggests a manga or anime setting.
