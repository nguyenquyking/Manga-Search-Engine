One Piece manga panel depicting a high-intensity battle.  A character with dark, spiky, demonic-like features (possibly a Devil Fruit user) unleashes a powerful, ice-and-fire-based attack.  Another character, with blue hair and glasses, is struggling to keep up, dodging the attack while uttering words of frustration. The second character appears to be using some form of dark magic or energy projectiles in response.  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines, fiery explosions, and icy shards, highlighting the power of the attack.  Text bubbles show internal monologue (“If I can stay away until then, I can win”) and dialogue (“Hold it right there, you jerk!”, “Not good, I can’t catch up!”, “Argh...it’s fast!”).  The overall mood is intense and action-packed.
