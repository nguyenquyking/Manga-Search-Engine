Black Clover manga color spread featuring a dramatic confrontation.  Charlotta is shown in the lower right panel, exclaiming "Char-lotte!!".  In the main panel, a fierce battle unfolds between a blonde woman (likely Mimosa Vermillion)  and a dark-haired woman (likely a villain) amidst thorny, rose-covered vines.  The blonde woman expresses affection ("I like you so much, and you still...") while the dark-haired woman questions her ("Boy, are you a meanie or what?"). The final panel shows a close-up of the blonde woman's determined face and the dark-haired womanâ€™s menacing grin,  the blonde woman inviting the dark-haired woman to join her ("All right!! Wanna come with me?!?").  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and a dark, intense color palette.
