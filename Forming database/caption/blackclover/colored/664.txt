A manga panel depicting a powerful magical confrontation. Two figures, possibly sorcerers, stand before a massive swirling vortex of intense orange and yellow flames.  One figure wears dark red/burgundy clothing.  The other has lighter colored hair and dark clothing. The flames appear to be a powerful magical attack.  In a smaller panel below, another individual with red armor and a large red headdress is shown reacting to an attack, possibly affected by "Picture Magic". The text indicates the combined power of Morris's modifications and a curse are creating a formidable opponent.
