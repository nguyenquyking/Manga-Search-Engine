Black Clover manga colorized panel depicting a scene with multiple characters.  A group of female characters, cheering and expressing excitement with speech bubbles saying "Amazing!!!" and "We're rooting for you, Captain!!!", surround a partially obscured central figure, presumably the Captain.  Another panel shows two characters, a male and a female, with speech bubbles revealing a secret relationship ("Actually, I have a boyfriend! We've been going out in secret, hehe!").  Other characters react with surprised expressions and comments about an "elegant girl and a rough guy" pairing.  The overall scene depicts a celebratory moment with a romantic subplot revealed.
