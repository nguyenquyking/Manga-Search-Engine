A large, monstrous, ice-encased figure with red eyes and horns dominates the left side of the panel.  Its hand, extending from the ice, is clawed and menacing.  Red cross-hatch marks emphasize the destructive force.  On the right, Lotus and another character (possibly an associate) observe the scene.  Lotus expresses concern, stating "Really bad..." while the other character remarks "It's all going perfectly," highlighting a stark contrast in their perspectives. The visual style suggests a scene from a manga or comic book, with onomatopoeia and dramatic visual effects.
