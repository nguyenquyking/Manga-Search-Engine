A severely wounded male character, possibly a young man, lies on the ground, crying and bleeding profusely from multiple wounds across his face and neck.  He wears a dark jacket with a gold button. Speech bubbles indicate pain and questioning ("Ugk...", "Rgh... Uu...", "Is this the end...?"). The scene is dark and somber, emphasizing the character's critical condition.  The lower panel shows a close-up of his body and a book lying nearby.  No other characters are visible.
