A powerful, demonic entity with immense, dual-colored wings (one icy blue, the other fiery orange) dominates the scene.  The creature, whose face is partially obscured, displays a menacing grin and declares its prey. Two characters, seemingly overwhelmed, observe the entity.  One, with dark hair and bloodied face, expresses fear and awe at the entity's overwhelming power. The other character, in red attire, is also visibly shaken.  The text indicates the entity's immense power is more than the sum of its parts, and that it plans to inflict suffering. The overall scene depicts a confrontation of overwhelming power against seemingly helpless opponents.
