This Black Clover manga panel depicts several scenes featuring Asta, Secre Swallowtail, and other characters.  The first panel shows Asta reacting with amazement to Secre's magic, who is using a powerful magic ability, leaving her visibly strained.  The second panel shows a conversation between Asta and a woman (possibly a flashback or a different scene). The woman comments on Asta's aura reminding her of someone she knows.  The final panel shows Asta being pinched by another female character (likely Noelle Silva) while she tells him to focus on the battle.  The overall scene depicts intense action and emotional reactions.
