Black Clover manga color spread depicting a nighttime scene.  Meroleona Vermillion, in a low-cut red dress, speaks with another character (partially visible, possibly Fuegoleon Vermillion).  Text indicates an upcoming captains' meeting.  A separate panel shows Asta asleep in his bed, sunlight streaming in.  The overall mood is one of rest and anticipation.
