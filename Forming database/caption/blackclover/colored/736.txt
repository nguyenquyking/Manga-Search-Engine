A colored manga panel depicts a fiery scene.  A massive, golden fire dragon, seemingly summoned, dominates the background, its flames engulfing buildings.  Astride the dragon is a figure in dark clothing, possibly a mage or powerful user of fire magic.  In the foreground, a close-up shows a man with red hair and intense eyes, possibly the main character, reacting to the fiery spectacle with awe and determination. Two other men, appearing to be his allies or companions, are visible in smaller panels, expressing their astonishment at the immense power on display.  The scene is dynamic and suggests a high-stakes battle or magical event. The text bubbles indicate that the powerful display is called the "fire spirit," and the characters discuss their shared desire to protect their citizens.
