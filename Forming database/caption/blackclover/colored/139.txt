Black Clover manga page 212, "At Fate's End," depicts the climactic battle. Asta's attack successfully strikes the demon, a 500-year-old source of hatred and revenge.  The demon, visibly injured and surprised, reacts with expressions of disbelief ("Impossible"). Asta, in contrast, expresses astonishment ("Unbelievable").  The scene is filled with dynamic action lines and splash effects emphasizing the intensity of the fight.  The art style is heavily stylized with dark and red tones dominating the demon's side, while Asta is rendered in brighter, contrasting colors.
