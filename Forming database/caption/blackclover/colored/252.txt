A Black Clover manga color spread depicting a blonde woman, possibly Noelle Silva, dramatically declaring her love for Yami. She is standing before a group of younger Black Clover members, who react with a mix of surprise and shock.  Noelle's speech bubbles emphasize the intensity of her feelings, and she is shown with flushed cheeks and wide eyes. The background shows a large building, possibly a Clover Kingdom structure. The artist's watermark is visible.
