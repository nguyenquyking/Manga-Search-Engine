A manga panel depicting a scene from what appears to be *Black Clover*.  The top panel shows a large, light-blue serpentine creature, possibly magical in nature, amidst a green forest.  Below, two panels show a male character, possibly Yami Sukehiro,  with dark hair and a distinctive amulet, exhaling in relief. He is wearing a light-colored, ornate outfit.  The text bubbles indicate he is commenting on the creature's power and his own near-miss. A third panel shows a close-up of the same character, seemingly questioning the creature's escape. The overall scene suggests a magical battle or confrontation.
