A Black Clover manga panel depicting a character, likely an elf, wielding a glowing white sword.  The character's face is partially visible, showing intense expression and red markings.  The character is surrounded by bright yellow light particles.  Text bubbles proclaim "TAKE THIS!!!" and "THE FURY OF THE ELVES!!!!"  A complex, glowing yellow geometric structure is also shown, seemingly related to the elf's power.  The overall scene suggests a powerful magical attack.
