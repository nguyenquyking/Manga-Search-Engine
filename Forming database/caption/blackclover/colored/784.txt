A colorized manga panel depicting a scene titled "Shadow Magic: Monument of Atonement."  A powerful, masked figure invites others to a "hellish game of tag" within a dark, purple, shadowy structure resembling a monument or altar.  Numerous shadowy tendrils extend from the structure, and smaller figures are visible within the structure's confines.  A second panel shows a close-up of a character, possibly the masked figure's opponent, being enveloped by the shadows. The text indicates the scene involves a sacrifice and imprisonment within a "world of shadows." The overall tone is dark and ominous, suggesting a high-stakes magical conflict.
