Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A large, fiery explosion dominates the center. Asta, with a surprised expression, is shown in the upper left panel, partially obscured by a monstrous, dark-colored creature's mouth.  In the central panels, a female character with light-colored hair is engulfed in flames, seemingly weakening the negative magic.  The lower right panel shows a female character with dark hair, expressing surprise, and Asta, with a determined expression, in the lower right. Text boxes indicate Asta's inability to fully absorb the magic power, the weakening of negative energy, and Asta's seizing of an opportunity.  The overall scene is intense and action-packed, focusing on a magical confrontation.
