A colored manga panel depicting a scene featuring three characters:  Patri, a light-skinned young man with white hair and a dark purple mark across his face, wearing a white robe;  Captain Yami Sukehiro, a dark-haired man with stubble,  and another character whose face is partially obscured. Patri appears contemplative, his hands clasped near his chest. Speech bubbles reveal dialogue about finding peace amidst anger and grief, suggesting a moment of emotional introspection. The scene also includes a visual representation of a glowing plant, possibly symbolizing growth or healing.  The overall mood is somber yet hopeful. The background features a light purple hue.  Yami's presence and the text suggest a complex relationship and possibly a past shared between him and Patri.
