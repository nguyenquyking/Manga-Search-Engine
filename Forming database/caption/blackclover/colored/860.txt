Black Clover manga panel depicting a intense fight scene.  A character with brown hair (likely the antagonist) is shown in multiple panels, his face bloodied and expression one of defiance or pain. He is restrained by a thick gold chain. Text bubbles indicate he's boasting about his regenerative abilities ("super-regenerating body magic") and that his opponent ("Now you can't use any decent spells!!!") is incapacitated. In a smaller panel, a second character (dark-haired, possibly the protagonist) is shown delivering a blow, suggesting a power struggle.  Another panel shows the two characters fighting earlier in the combat. Blood splatter and intense shading add to the dramatic effect.
