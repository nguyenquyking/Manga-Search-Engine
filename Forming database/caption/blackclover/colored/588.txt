Black Clover manga panel depicting Nacht Faust, holding a grimoire, standing beside a large, shadowy, demonic-looking creature.  A text box states, "People who are right aren't necessarily rewarded."  Another panel shows a figure sinking into water, possibly indicating defeat or sacrifice.  A subsequent panel shows Asta's surprised expression, and Nacht, seemingly emanating dark energy, advising him to "get stronger."  The overall scene suggests a moment of reflection and strategic instruction amidst a battle or significant event.
