A manga panel depicting a powerful magic attack.  Two characters, seemingly defeated, are shown severely injured amidst shattered stone fragments. One has orange hair, the other has green hair.  A third character, with grey hair and horns, observes the scene, commenting that the opponent's strength stemmed from the mansion's magic, now destroyed. The attack is depicted as a large, blue, ice-based explosion. The word "GRUNCH" is visible amidst the destruction. The overall scene suggests a decisive victory for the horned character.
