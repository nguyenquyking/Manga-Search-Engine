Black Clover manga panel depicting a massive, swirling, dark-grey vortex emanating from a mountain with a circular hole, seemingly sucking in the landscape.  A male character with dark hair, wielding a sword, is caught in the vortex's edge.  Another panel shows a smaller, winged, dark-colored figure, possibly a demon or magical creature, near a second character with spiky green hair, who is shocked and reacting with a surprised expression, and a speech bubble exclaiming "What theâ€¦?!"  The text indicates the surrounding area has vanished.
