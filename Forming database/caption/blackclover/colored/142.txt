Black Clover manga color spread depicting the aftermath of a battle.  Two characters, Asta and Liebe (implied), are shown sweating profusely, exclaiming "We...Won!".  A bright light emanating from a group of figures is in the background.  Another panel shows a heavily injured, sweating character, possibly a defeated opponent, breathing heavily ("Huff"). A third panel shows a sweating female character, possibly a worried ally or bystander, with a speech bubble containing ellipses.  The panels are surrounded by grayscale manga panels, suggesting a flashback or a montage of past events.  The watermark "@ColorClovers" and "Psycho PP" are visible.
