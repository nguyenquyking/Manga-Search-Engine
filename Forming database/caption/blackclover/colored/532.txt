Black Clover manga panel depicting a discussion among several characters.  A dark-haired male character, central to the panel, expresses disdain for judging individuals based solely on appearance.  He's surrounded by other characters, including a pink-haired woman and several teal-haired women, seated in a damaged room. Another dark-haired male character, standing alone in a separate panel, is addressed as a "bunch of good-for-nothings" recruited by Yami.  The overall theme revolves around appearance versus inherent goodness.
