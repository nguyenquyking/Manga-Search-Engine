Black Clover manga color spread depicting a battle scene.  Two female characters, one with dark hair and devilish wings (likely a devil possessing a human), the other with long white hair wearing ornate silver armor, are engaged in fierce combat.  The dark-haired character is injured and taunting the white-haired one.  The white-haired character appears equally wounded and is retaliating.  A speech bubble comments on the intensity and power of the fight. Another character, possibly the same dark-haired character, is shown in a smaller panel preparing for another attack, accompanied by an onomatopoeia. The background suggests an outdoor setting.
