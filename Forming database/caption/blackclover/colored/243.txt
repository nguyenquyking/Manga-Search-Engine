Black Clover manga panel depicting a conversation between two female characters and flashbacks. One character, a light-skinned woman with blonde hair, expresses relief that Yami (implied, not explicitly shown) rescued her and reflects on how close she felt to him in her memories (shown as panels within the larger panel).  The other character, a dark-skinned woman with dark curly hair, comforts her, stating it wasn't her fault.  The dark-skinned woman also comments on Yami's positive qualities.  The scene conveys emotional vulnerability and relief, centered on Yami's actions and the close bond between the women.
