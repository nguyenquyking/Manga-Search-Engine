Black Clover manga scene depicting multiple characters interacting with a powerful light source.  Atop, Licht's face is shown, eyes wide, with the word "LICHT..." in a speech bubble. Below, a figure with fiery wings is enveloped in a bright yellow light.  Another character, possibly a dark-haired man, looks on.  In the lower panel, a light-haired, possibly Yuno, appears to be levitating within a similar bright yellow light.  Next to him, a character with silver hair and purple eyes, possibly a member of the Black Bulls, stands near a glowing green, geometric structure, with a girl with orange hair and floral attire beside them.  The scene suggests a magical event or transformation.
