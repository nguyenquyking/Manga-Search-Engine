A close-up of an intensely angry character's face, possibly a male, with dark hair and glowing red eyes, dominates the top half.  He's partially obscured by shadow and a dark garment.  Speech bubbles reveal his resentment, stating his survival is due to the character's unjust evil and that he doesn't care if he dies. The bottom half shows a large, stately house, identified as the House of Faust, home to a distinguished noble family with twin sons. The overall mood is dark and dramatic.
