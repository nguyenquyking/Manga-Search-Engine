Here's a caption describing the provided Black Clover manga image:  Close-up of Asta's angry face, shouting "It doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad guy!!!"  in response to someone (implied to be a devil) stating "Just because you're a devil...".  A subsequent panel shows a shadowy, devil-like eye. The final panel depicts Asta and a woman (possibly Sister Lily) running through a smoky, red-tinged area; Asta looks concerned, and the woman's face is obscured.  The overall scene suggests confrontation and Asta's defiance.
