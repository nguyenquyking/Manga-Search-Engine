Colorized manga panel depicting a dramatic scene. Lolo-Pechka, a female character with a crown and glowing red eyes, is shown in the upper panel, having apparently defeated an opponent.  She declares the opponent is incapacitated due to agonizing pain.  The lower panels show a distressed female character, possibly Lolo-Pechka's ally, crying and injured. Another character, possibly male, with red eyes and dark clothing, observes, stating "Nope. She's had it."  The overall tone is dark and intense.
