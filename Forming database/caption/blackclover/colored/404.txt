A colorized manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  The top panel shows a character, seemingly female, with short, light gray hair and purple eyes,  covered in blood and surrounded by a blue, water-like energy. She is shouting, "I'M NOT DONE YET!"  The blue energy suggests a powerful magic attack. The bottom panel shows a close-up of two eyes: one with a purple iris,  belonging to the character from the top panel,  and a second eye with a red iris, belonging to a separate character.  The second character's eye is distorted, implying injury or a magical effect. Text bubbles indicate the first character's attack has no relation to the other character's injuries.  The second character's speech bubble states "POWER DIFFERENTIALS..." highlighting a significant power disparity between the two combatants.
