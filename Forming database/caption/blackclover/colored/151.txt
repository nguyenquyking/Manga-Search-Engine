Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows two shirtless men, one with long purple hair and the other with gray hair, standing in a dark, purplish-red liquid.  The gray-haired man speaks of atonement.  A smaller panel shows Asta, shocked and reacting to something off-panel. Another panel shows Asta arguing with the purple and gray haired men, who are submerged in a dark liquid.  The final panel shows a close-up of the gray-haired man's profile, seemingly determined, alongside another character with distinctive red markings on their face.  The overall narrative suggests conflict and a determination to atone for past actions.
