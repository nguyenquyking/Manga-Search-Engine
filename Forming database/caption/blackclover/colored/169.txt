ColorClover's fan art depicting a confrontation between two characters. A furious, light-pink haired character, possibly a magical user,  threatens another pale-haired character. The pink-haired character is enraged, vowing revenge and promising a life of fear. The pale-haired character appears remorseful, expressing a desire for atonement.  Another scene shows two characters, possibly allies of the pink-haired one, preparing for action. The art style is reminiscent of One Piece manga, featuring dramatic expressions and dynamic poses.  The text includes strong language.
