A Black Clover manga panel depicts a dark, ominous scene.  A large, central image shows a mass of shadowy figures with glowing red eyes, resembling demonic entities, surrounding a dark, tree-like structure with circular symbols.  The scene is framed by a character's large, expressive blue eyes, suggesting horror or shock.  Smaller panels below show Lolo Petchka in distress, seemingly surrounded by water, and another character reacting with shock and tears, saying "This is...Horrible!!!"  The text indicates the Dark Triad's malevolent influence.  The overall mood is one of impending doom and overwhelming darkness.
