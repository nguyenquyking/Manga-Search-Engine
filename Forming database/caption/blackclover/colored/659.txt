Black Clover manga scene depicting a confrontation between two characters.  A green-haired character, possibly Licht (judging by appearance and magical attributes),  surrounded by bright green mana,  is labeled "BELOVED" and attacks using a powerful mana-based attack.  He is facing a dark-haired character, possibly Asta (judging by appearance and the dialogue). Asta appears somewhat surprised or skeptical, questioning the opponent's statement about dying before Asta could take a single step.  The scene showcases intense magical energy and dynamic action lines suggesting a powerful clash.  The dialogue indicates a determined and potentially fatal confrontation.
