Black Clover manga panel depicting a dynamic battle scene.  A light-haired character, possibly Asta, wielding a glowing golden sword, clashes with a dark, shadowy opponent.  The scene is filled with intense energy effects, represented by purple and yellow streaks, suggesting powerful magic clashes. The opponent's attacks are dark and shadowy, contrasting sharply with the bright light of the protagonist's weapon.  A second panel shows the light-haired character mid-attack, their sword emitting a powerful energy blast.  Text bubbles indicate dialogue expressing surprise at the opponent's skill in avoiding the attack.
