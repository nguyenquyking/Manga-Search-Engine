One Piece manga color spread featuring two characters, Zora and another unnamed character, amidst a chaotic scene of scattered papers. Zora, with red hair and a black mask, expresses amazement at a large array of papers.  The other character, with short grey hair and sunglasses, observes the scene with intrigue.  The unnamed character previously mused about winning through sheer grit, while another character (possibly off-panel) is shown reacting in disbelief to a powerful magic display. The overall scene is dynamic and suggestive of a strategic planning or magical spell preparation.
