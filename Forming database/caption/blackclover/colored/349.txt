Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A colorized manga panel depicts a scene where a woman with dark hair and glasses sits on a throne.  A large, ethereal, blue-haired woman is behind her, seemingly emanating from the throne. To the right, a smaller figure, possibly a soldier, stands. Text reveals that the Spade Kingdom's troops are mobilizing within half a year.  The overall color scheme is cool-toned, with blues and greens dominating.  The top panel shows a close-up of wide, expressive eyes, perhaps hinting at the perspective of a character observing the scene.
