One Piece manga scene depicting a battle.  A character with grey hair and dark clothing faces a powerful, winged, purple entity.  Text indicates an attack is underway. A large explosion, seemingly a powerful energy blast, is shown in the next panel, with another character running away from it. Finally, a horned, dark-cloaked figure appears, seemingly unaffected by the events.  The scene is primarily dark with shades of purple and orange from the energy blasts.
