Here's a caption describing the provided Black Clover manga image:  A bloodied Noelle Silva, a Clover Kingdom royal and Magic Knight of the Black Bulls, is shown in a distressed state.  She's clutching a book, possibly a spell book.  Another character, seemingly a dark-clad antagonist with red eyes and devil-like wings, observes her with a surprised expression ("Huh?").  The antagonist questions Noelle's identity.  The panels convey a tense moment of confrontation, emphasizing Noelle's injuries and the antagonist's reaction.  The colorization style is vibrant.
