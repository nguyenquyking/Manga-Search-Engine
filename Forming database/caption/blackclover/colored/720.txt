A colored manga panel depicting a large-scale magical confrontation.  A man in green robes, seemingly using scale magic, attempts to counter a powerful, phenomenally vast magical attack.  He holds a scale, indicating his magic's nature ("Scale Magic: Scale Regulate"). The attack is so powerful he cannot negate it completely. In another panel, a counter-attack, described as equally phenomenal magic, is launched. The intense, red-hued energy clashes with the initial attack.  Other panels show bystanders witnessing the event, one clearly impressed by the "ludicrously strong" magic, and another noting its "beauty."  A monstrous, dark-colored figure with horns and glowing eyes is shown unleashing the initial phenomenal magic.
