One Piece manga colorized scene depicting a confrontation. A woman pleads for mercy for her child, who is bound.  A blond man in dark attire, seemingly a high-ranking official, smirks condescendingly.  The woman and child are visibly distressed. Another panel shows the blond man menacingly approaching a woman from the military, questioning her audacity. The overall tone is one of intimidation and power imbalance.
