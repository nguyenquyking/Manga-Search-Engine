A four-panel colored manga-style image depicting a climactic battle scene.  The top left panel shows a defeated figure lying amidst dark vines.  The top right panel shows a blonde-haired female character, possibly wielding swords, standing over a bloodied, white-haired male character who appears to be severely injured. Both panels include "FUOOOH" sound effects.  A speech bubble between these panels states, "This time...". The middle left panel shows a figure engulfed in bright blue energy, also with "FUOOOH". The bottom panel shows a large, monstrous blue entity with multiple gaping maws, and a smaller figure standing before it.  The middle right panel shows the same white haired, injured male character from the top right panel. A speech bubble between the middle panels states "...it truly is over."  The overall scene suggests a final confrontation with a powerful antagonist, possibly involving magic or supernatural forces.  The color scheme is predominantly dark and blue.  Watermarks "@XVALCLOVER" and "@COLORCLOVERS" are present.
