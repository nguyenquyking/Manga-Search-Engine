A manga panel depicting a dark, ominous scene.  A character, seemingly Lolopechka, threatens to detonate something, killing everyone in the castle.  The background shows a network of red, vine-like structures spreading across a grey castle.  Another panel shows a close-up of Lolopechka's face, with a sinister expression and one visible, glowing blue eye.  She states she will fully manifest.  A smaller, injured female character lies in the foreground of a side panel.  A third panel shows a dark, shadowy figure emerging, suggesting a transformation or manifestation.  The overall tone is dark and foreboding, hinting at impending destruction and a powerful transformation.
