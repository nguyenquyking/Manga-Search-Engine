A dynamic manga panel depicting a powerful clash.  A light-haired character, possibly a mage, is shown being thrown backwards by a brilliant, explosive energy beam.  This beam originates from a horned, demonic-looking figure, possibly a devil or powerful antagonist, who appears to be suffering from the force of their own attack.  The scene is filled with intense motion lines and bright, radiating light effects suggesting a magical confrontation.  The lower panels show further action and effects, possibly depicting the aftermath of the attack or subsequent blows, with additional characters partially visible.  The overall visual style suggests a high-energy battle scene, possibly from a fantasy-based manga like Black Clover.
