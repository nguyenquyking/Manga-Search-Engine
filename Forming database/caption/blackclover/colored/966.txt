Manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A character, seemingly an antagonist, initially underestimated humans, believing they posed no threat.  The panels show a powerful energy burst, possibly a manifestation of human emotions, overwhelming the antagonist. The final panel shows a female character, seemingly injured, being attacked by another character with gray hair. The antagonist's initial disbelief and subsequent surprise at the power of human emotions are highlighted in thought bubbles.  The style suggests a colored manga page.
