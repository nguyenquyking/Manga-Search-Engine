Two Black Clover characters discuss magic techniques. One, with spiky, light-colored hair and glasses, explains that using a specific style requires significant magic, instincts, and reflexes.  He contrasts this with the other character, a red-haired individual wearing a dark, studded mask, who admits to lacking those capabilities.  The masked character explains their own approach involves slowly assembling magic arrays beforehand, highlighting a difference in magical style and power level.  Smaller panels depict examples of fast-paced combat magic.
