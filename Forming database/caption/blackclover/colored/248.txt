Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene of the Color Clovers team.  A bird of prey flies overhead a medieval-style town in the background. Asta and a female character with black hair express surprise ("What the??").  A blonde woman in a blue dress screams in terror ("AAAA" repeated) while running.  Another character appears briefly in the lower right panel, partially obscured.  The scene suggests a sudden event or threat.
