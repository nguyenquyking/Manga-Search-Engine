A Black Clover manga panel depicting a Dark Triad member, Zillence, in two distinct states.  The top panel shows Zillence, seemingly unharmed, in a dark, stone-walled room. He smirks, displaying a confident demeanor. Text bubbles indicate his magic recovery speed is remarkable and that his body magic is running wild. Another text bubble notes the opponent's surprise at Zillence's power, typical of a Dark Triad member.  The bottom panel shows a drastically altered Zillence, his body contorted and decaying, with cracked skin and exposed muscle. He roars in rage, declaring his immortality and vowing to crush his opponents.  Visual elements include speed lines and onomatopoeia ("KRAK," "ZZT") enhancing the action and power portrayed.
