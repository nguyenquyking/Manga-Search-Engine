A two-panel One Piece fan art depiction.  Panel one shows a dark ritual scene with a cloaked figure observing a large, dark, hand-like magical construct emanating from a circular summoning area. Text indicates forbidden magic was used to disrupt the earth, and that demons cannot appear in this world unless something irregular happens. Panel two depicts a witch-like character seated on a throne overlooking a landscape. Text indicates that these shadows are now crawling like worms in their world.  The artist is credited as @xCatharsys.
