Black Clover manga panel depicting a magical battle.  Multiple characters are shown engaged in combat.  A large, shadowy figure dominates the top and bottom panels, possibly a powerful entity or demon. The middle panels show two distinct scenes of conflict.  In the upper middle scene, a green magical entity confronts a cloaked figure in a throne room.  The lower middle panel shows a figure in dark clothing, possibly Asta, confronting a figure in gold and black amidst a field of roses and magical energy.  Magical effects and impact lines are prominent throughout.  The specific names of the characters are not visible but can be inferred from context within the Black Clover narrative.
