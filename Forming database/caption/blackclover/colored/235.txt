Black Clover manga scene depicting a mission briefing.  A high-ranking official (possibly the Magic Emperor) informs the Black Bulls, a magic knight squad, including Asta,  about a new mission: monitoring a person linked to a demon in exile and investigating the demon's activities outside the country.  The scene shows Asta reacting with surprise ("What...?") along with other Black Bulls members.  The overall tone suggests urgency and importance.
