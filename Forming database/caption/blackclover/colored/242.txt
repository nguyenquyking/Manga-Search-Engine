This One Piece fan art depicts a scene with two main characters, Marx and Sol.  Marx, a blond-haired character with purple eyes, expresses his unwillingness to forgive an unnamed individual.  Sol, a blonde woman in a light blue dress, sits on a bed, appearing distraught and apologizing for her failure to protect others, expressing regret over her actions as a captain.  The background shows a panoramic view of a town, followed by an interior scene of a bedroom. The art style is reminiscent of the One Piece manga, showcasing a colorized version of the comic panels.
