A Black Clover manga panel depicts a scene where a demon, identified by the text "T/N: DEMON SPELL," unleashes repulsive word magic. The magic is visualized as a dark, bloody circular entity with kanji characters within it, labeled "WORD MAGIC."  A male character, possibly Asta,  observes this magic, reacting with a look of disgust and surprise. His speech bubbles express his shock at the demon's powerful and repulsive magic. The demon's speech bubble shows an apology.  The overall mood is one of intense conflict and awe.
