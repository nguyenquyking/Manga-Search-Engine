A colored manga panel depicting a fierce battle.  A wounded man, possibly Nacht, with dark hair and tan clothing, is shown bleeding profusely, with dark purplish-black demonic wings.  He is engaged in combat with a large, pale, monstrous entity emitting purple energy.  A woman with light purple hair, potentially Gaga, witnesses the scene with a shocked expression. Another panel shows a close-up of Nacht's wounded face.  The overall color palette is predominantly purple and dark tones. The word "KRAKL" is visible near the monstrous entity, possibly an onomatopoeia for sound.  A final panel shows a woman with black hair attacking a man, possibly further illustrating the battle's intensity.
