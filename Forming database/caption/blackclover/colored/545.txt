A Black Clover manga panel depicts a fierce confrontation. Asta, in a pained expression, is slammed into the ground by an unseen force, his body contorted.  Asta's opponent, whose face is partially visible in a subsequent panel, is shown with sharp teeth and a menacing glare. The opponent declares, "You walked right into my turf," and intends to take more than just Asta's arm.  The scene is dynamic, with intense action lines and a red color scheme emphasizing the intensity of the fight.  Asta's dialogue indicates his reluctance to fight and a plea to be heard.
