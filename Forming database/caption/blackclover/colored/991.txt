A colored manga panel depicting a dramatic confrontation.  On the left, a character with reddish-brown hair is bound in chains by a skeletal figure with dark wings.  The bound character appears to be a member of the Golden Dawn.  On the right, a close-up shows an enraged character with light brown hair and teal eyes,  possibly reacting to the scene on the left.  Text indicates the bound character knew about the Ultimate Brigade, and the enraged character mentions the Golden Dawn. Blood is visible on the enraged character's face.  The overall mood is intense and violent.
