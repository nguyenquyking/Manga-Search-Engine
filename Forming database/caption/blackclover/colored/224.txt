A colored manga panel depicting the Black Bulls squad from Black Clover.  Asta is called out in a speech bubble.  Yami Sukehiro is centrally positioned, smoking, with other Black Bulls members surrounding him:  Finral Roulacase,  Charmy Pappitson, Gordon Agrippa, Grey, Gauche Adlai,  and  Luck Voltia.  Additional characters include a woman on a broom (likely a witch) and two other individuals in the background. The scene shows the Black Bulls seemingly regrouping or preparing for an action, with a sense of determination. The words "The Black... ...Bulls...!!!" are prominently featured.  The overall mood is serious and action-oriented.
