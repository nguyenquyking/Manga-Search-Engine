Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a group of individuals, seemingly antagonists, are demanding magic from a young woman.  One man speaks, offering a "special role" in exchange for her cooperation. Another man scoffs at their lack of offensive magic. A blonde man with striking green eyes laughs menacingly.  A young woman with dark hair is shown partially undressed, implying a forced sacrifice or submission.  The overall tone suggests coercion and exploitation.
