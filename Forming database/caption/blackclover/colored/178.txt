Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a dark-haired male character, possibly Yami Sukehiro, reacting to the absence of Julius Novachrono's body at a large crater.  Asta expresses surprise ("Ain't here...!?"), while the other character is shocked ("...What the hell...?").  The scene suggests a mystery surrounding Julius's disappearance, as his body was believed to be there but is missing.  The panel also shows a flashback-style image of a similar crater.
