Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A Black Clover manga panel depicts a confrontation between two characters.  The top panel shows two close-ups of a devilish figure with horns and a mask, one slightly wounded. The bottom panel shows a battle scene in a ruined environment.  One character, seemingly Asta (judging by the anti-magic energy), is crouched, his body emitting a bright, lime-green energy, possibly indicating his magic adapting.  His opponent, a shadowy figure with dark wings, is positioned opposite him.  Text bubbles indicate the characters are commenting on each other's magic abilities.
