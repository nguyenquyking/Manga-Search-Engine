Black Clover manga panel depicting multiple scenes.  The first shows a conversation between a young woman with dark hair and horns and an older, crowned man with gray hair and a partially obscured face. The older man expresses gratitude for the young woman's contributions and acknowledges her potential. The second shows a group of figures standing atop a structure, possibly a castle ruin. The third panel shows two younger women, one with blonde hair and the other with lavender hair, reacting joyfully.  They are alongside the older man from the first panel, who is now older and visibly worn.  The dialogue expresses happiness at the future and meeting descendants.  The overall scene suggests a generational handover or a significant moment of reflection after a major conflict. Characters are unnamed in the image.
