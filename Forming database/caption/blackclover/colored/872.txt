Black Clover manga panel depicting a battle scene.  A powerful, demonic-looking character with red, devilish wings and a mask unleashes a massive dark energy attack, labeled "FUOOOH."  This attack engulfs another character, a blonde woman wearing a crown of roses and a yellow/green robe, who is wounded and reacting with shock ("AH HA!!"). A shorter, white-haired male character is also nearby, appearing to be injured and assisting the woman. The scene is chaotic, filled with dark energy and scattered roses.  Smaller panels show the demonic character commenting on the strength of their teamwork ("I GUESS OUR TEAMWORK WAS STRONGER") and the blonde woman acknowledging the potency of the opponent's blood magic ("HER BLOOD MAGIC IS STRONG ALL BY ITSELF!!").
