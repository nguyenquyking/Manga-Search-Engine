Black Clover manga page 220 depicts the aftermath of a kingdom battle.  The top panel shows a heavily damaged castle, illustrating the scale of destruction.  Below, smaller panels show a blond-haired female character, possibly Noelle Silva, cheerfully saying "Heyo!", and another character, possibly Asta, sitting in a room seemingly recovering from injuries. The overall scene suggests a visit to the injured following a significant battle.  The artist's credit is visible.
