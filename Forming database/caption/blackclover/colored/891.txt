Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A four-panel manga spread depicts a powerful, sinister-looking female character with sharp teeth and glowing pink markings, gleefully stating, "Very, very, very good!!"  She appears to be the source of a destructive pink energy shown in the adjacent panel, where text indicates the Red Beasts have been destroyed.  The next panel shows a woman with light blue hair wielding ice magic, urged to quickly finish an opponent. The final panel shows a blonde woman with blue roses and a boy observing the battle, commenting on the blue roses weakening the curse-warding magic.  The overall scene suggests a powerful battle with significant magical elements.
