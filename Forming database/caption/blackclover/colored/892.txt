A colored manga panel depicts a fierce battle.  A character with light-grey hair and turquoise, winged attire, declares "I'LL END THIS IN 30 SECONDS!!".  She's engaged in combat with another figure, partially obscured but seemingly dark-colored, possibly in a dark robe. The scene is dynamic, filled with motion lines indicating speed and impact.  The turquoise-clad character is shown in multiple panels, suggesting rapid movement and attack.  The word "WHIRR" is present near her wings, indicating the sound effect. There's a powerful energy effect visible in red hues, suggesting a destructive force.  Another character, also possibly in light-colored armor, appears to be falling or flying through this energy field.  The overall tone is intense and action-packed.
