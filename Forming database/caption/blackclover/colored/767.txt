A manga panel depicting a scene with multiple characters from the Faust family.  Two older figures, possibly Morgen and another family member, stand in a dark, gothic-styled room, illuminated by purple light,  addressing a younger individual.  Text indicates the family's generations-long devotion to studying devils and the younger individual's inherited magic and spirit. A separate panel showcases the younger character,  experiencing intense emotion and temptation due to their inherited malice. The younger character is smoking, showing a conflicted internal state.  The overall tone is dark, mysterious, and suggestive of a supernatural power struggle within the family.
