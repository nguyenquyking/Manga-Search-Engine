A colored manga panel depicting a catastrophic event.  A large explosion or impact is shown in the upper panel, sending debris flying.  The lower panels show several characters reacting with fear and shock.  People in formal attire are visible, expressing alarm ("What's going on...?," "Kya Aa!!," "What...?!").  In the bottom panel, two additional characters are shown, one appearing distressed ("AHHHH~"), possibly Asta, the other with a concerned expression. The scene suggests a sudden, powerful attack or disaster within a formal setting.  The artist's Twitter handle (@shawnfrostmax11) and the team's handle (@Color Clovers) are also present.
