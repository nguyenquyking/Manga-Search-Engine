A colored manga panel depicting a fierce battle. A powerful energy beam, bright yellow, strikes a dark, tree-like structure emitting red energy.  The structure shows signs of damage. Text indicates sounds (“RMBL”, “AAAA”) and onomatopoeia. In the lower panels, a female character with white hair, possibly Asta (Black Clover), launches an attack, aiming to pierce a weak point.  Her attack is depicted as a blue energy blast. Text bubbles show her determination ("I need just enough Saint Stage power to pierce its exposed weak point," and "I don't care if it's weak!!", "Just one more attack!!!") showcasing her resolve during the intense confrontation. The overall scene is dynamic and action-packed, emphasizing the power of the attacks and the determination of the character.
