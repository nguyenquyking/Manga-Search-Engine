Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image panels:  **Panel 1:** A female character with white hair, possibly Noelle Silva, unleashes a powerful water-based attack, depicted as a blue energy blast, toward a smaller figure seemingly being engulfed in the attack.  The words "LOLO-PECH-KAAAAAAA!!!" are present as an onomatopoeia for the attack.  **Panel 2:** Noelle's attack directly impacts another female character, who is seen recoiling from the force.  The impact is illustrated with motion lines and the word "SMACK".  The impacted character is partially submerged in water-like energy.  **Panel 3:** A large, dark red explosion occurs in a forested area. A smaller, bat-like creature is flying away from the explosion;  the sound effect "ZWAH" indicates the impact.  A partially visible stone inscription is present in the background. A pale, horned creature is also visible in the lower right corner.
