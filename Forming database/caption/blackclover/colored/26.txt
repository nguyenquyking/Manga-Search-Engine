Black Clover manga panel depicting a large-scale magic attack.  A powerful beam of light, possibly emanating from the legendary First Magic Emperor (partially visible, crowned figure), sweeps across a landscape.  A present-day Magic Knight expresses gratitude.  Another character uses "Reverse Seal Magic," possibly countering or reacting to the attack. The scene shows a dramatic moment of conflict, with high-stakes magical power displayed.
