A bloody battle scene in a One Piece manga style illustration. A blonde-haired character is impaled by a monstrous, skeletal creature with numerous spindly appendages.  The creature is light grey with a red eye and sharp teeth. The blonde character, seemingly wielding a fiery weapon, is severely wounded and bleeding profusely. The text overlay reads "WITHOUT POWER... ...NEITHER EMOTIONS NOR TENACITY MEAN A THING." Smaller panels below depict further details of the fight, showing broken metal restraints and the creature's form in different stages of the attack.
