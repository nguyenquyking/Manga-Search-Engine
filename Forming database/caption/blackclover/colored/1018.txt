Black Clover manga scene depicting Asta's emotional reaction after failing to destroy the devil's heart.  Asta, wounded and distressed, is shown in the lower left panel.  The upper panel shows a powerful, horned devil-like creature, possibly Lucifero, with a fallen soldier in the background.  Another character, possibly Yami Sukehiro, lies injured near the devil. The devil's immense power is emphasized by the visual effects and the dialogue, indicating the failure of even powerful spatial magic.
