Black Clover manga panel depicting Asta and a cloaked figure, possibly a dark magic user.  Asta, surprised, observes the cloaked figure using shadow magic in a dilapidated room.  The subsequent panel shows Asta and the figure descending into a "Dark Garden Invitation," a dark, skull-filled abyss with glowing blue lines emanating from the ground.  The overall scene suggests a confrontation or a perilous journey into a magical realm.
