Here's a caption describing the provided manga image:  A colored manga panel depicting a dramatic scene.  A long-haired woman, possibly grieving, expresses hope for a new morning while commenting on two individuals.  A devil-like figure, possibly Asta, urgently declares the need to maintain a Devil Union for only five minutes. The panel then shows this devil-like figure in action, followed by a close-up on another character reacting with surprise. The final panel showcases two figures, possibly representing elemental forces (ice and fire), engaged in a confrontation.  The overall mood is tense and action-oriented.
