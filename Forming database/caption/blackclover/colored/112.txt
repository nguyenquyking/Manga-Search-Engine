Here's a caption describing the provided One Piece manga image:  A Black Clover manga panel depicts Asta,  expressing alarm ("This is bad...!" and "We'll get swallowed up...!"), reacting to a powerful, overwhelming force ("What strong pressure..."). Another character, likely a female Black Bull member (possibly Noelle Silva given the hair style, though not confirmed), is visibly shocked and disgusted ("Wh... What's that unappetizing stuff...?!"), witnessing the same overwhelming event.  The final panel shows three figures engulfed in a bright, intense energy burst. The overall scene suggests a powerful and potentially dangerous magical event unfolding, with characters struggling against its effects.
