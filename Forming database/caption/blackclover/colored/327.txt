Black Clover manga panel depicting a scene where a group of mages are being tested.  A male mage in gold and black attire explains that he forced the battle to test their "magic level".  Three younger mages, one with light purple hair and a crown-like headpiece, one with light brown hair, and another with short brown hair, react with surprise.  The scene shifts to show a powerful water-based magic attack, possibly related to the test.  A female mage with dark hair and glasses observes the scene, explaining that magic battles are determined by the strength of magic, not numbers.
